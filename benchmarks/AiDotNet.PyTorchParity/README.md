# AiDotNet ⇄ PyTorch parity benchmark

An in-repo twin of the [AIsEval](https://github.com/ooples/AIsEval)
`aidotnet-benchmarks` harness, with one decisive difference: this project
references the AiDotNet **source** (`<ProjectReference Include="..\..\src\AiDotNet.csproj" />`),
not a published NuGet package. So it measures the **current working tree** —
the exact thing you want when validating a perf change before it ships.

That makes it the validation harness for changes a released-package benchmark
can't yet see, e.g.:

- **PR #1469** — the default-Adam fused-training gate (set `AIDOTNET_FUSED_DIAG=1`
  to print whether the compiled fused step actually engages: `Hit=True`).
- **`FeedForwardNeuralNetwork.Predict` → `IEngine.MlpForward`** fused-inference
  wiring — compare the `mlp` row (high-level `Predict`) against the `mlp-fused`
  row (direct kernel call). With the wiring in place they should converge.

Both sides build the same four reference models with matching layer shapes
(MLP / CNN / LSTM / Transformer), run the same training + multi-batch-inference
loop, and emit the same JSON schema. `pytorch/compare.py` lines the two reports
up row-by-row.

## 1. Run the AiDotNet side

```bash
# From the repo root. Release is mandatory for meaningful numbers.
# Match the thread count to the PyTorch side for a fair head-to-head.
set AIDOTNET_BLAS_THREADS=8          # PowerShell: $env:AIDOTNET_BLAS_THREADS=8
set AIDOTNET_FUSED_DIAG=1            # optional: print fused-path Hit/Miss

dotnet run -c Release --project benchmarks/AiDotNet.PyTorchParity -- \
    --models mlp,cnn,lstm,transformer,mlp-fused \
    --epochs 3 --train-batches 20 --batch-size 64 \
    --inference-iterations 100 --warmup-iterations 10 \
    --output benchmarks/AiDotNet.PyTorchParity/results/aidotnet.json
```

The harness pins the CPU engine via `AiDotNetEngine.ResetToCpu()` so the
comparison is CPU-vs-CPU (the integrated-GPU/OpenCL auto-detect path is slower
for these small/medium workloads and is not what the Tensors micro-benchmarks
beat PyTorch on).

## 2. Run the PyTorch side

```bash
cd benchmarks/AiDotNet.PyTorchParity/pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
python benchmark.py --models mlp,cnn,lstm,transformer --device cpu \
    --threads 8 --output ../results/pytorch.json
```

PyTorch runs **eager** here (no `torch.compile`) on purpose: the AiDotNet side
runs its own compiled/fused path, and pitting it against a separately compiled
PyTorch compares two compilation stacks rather than the kernels. Pin both sides
to the same thread count (`--threads` ↔ `AIDOTNET_BLAS_THREADS`).

## 3. Compare

```bash
cd benchmarks/AiDotNet.PyTorchParity/pytorch
python compare.py ../results/aidotnet.json ../results/pytorch.json
```

Prints a per-model / per-batch table with the latency ratio and verdict. The
gate (from AIsEval `Reporting/findings.md`) is **p95(AiDotNet) < mean(PyTorch)**:
our worst-of-95% steady-state latency still beats their average.

## CLI options (both sides)

| flag | default | meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--models` | `mlp,cnn,lstm,transformer` | comma-separated subset; C# side also accepts `mlp-fused` |
| `--epochs` | `3` | training epochs |
| `--train-batches` | `20` | batches per epoch |
| `--batch-size` | `64` | training batch size |
| `--inference-iterations` | `100` | steady-state inference iterations per batch size |
| `--warmup-iterations` | `10` | warmup iterations before measuring |
| `--seed` | `1234` | RNG seed |
| `--output` | `results/{aidotnet,pytorch}.json` | report path |
| `--threads` (PyTorch) | `0` (all cores) | pin CPU threads; match `AIDOTNET_BLAS_THREADS` |

Inference is measured at batch sizes **1, 8, 32, 128** on both sides.

## Notes

- `results/` is git-ignored (machine-specific timings don't belong in version control).
- `mlp-fused` is an AiDotNet-only primitive variant (direct `MlpForward`); the
  PyTorch side maps it to the same `MLP` so a shared `--models` list won't error.
- This project is excluded from `dotnet test` (`IsTestProject=false`); it's a
  manual harness you run on demand.
