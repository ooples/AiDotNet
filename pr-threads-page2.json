Earlier samples that formed the batch receive only “in-batch” partial gradients, not the finalized amortized contribution; subsequent samples (from the next batch) receive the cached average. This misaligns loss and gradient with contributing samples and weakens RKD.\n\nRecommendation:\n- Switch trainer/strategy API to batch-level for RKD (return per-sample losses/gradients for the same batch), or\n- Cache per-sample RKD gradients for the completed batch (array of Vector<T>, not a single average), then apply them to the next N calls strictly corresponding to those batch slots (and clear afterward). Document the approximation if batch API changes are not possible.\n\nThis is a correctness concern for RKD signal strength. \n\n\n\n\nAlso applies to: 295-366\n\n---\n\n🏁 Script executed:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\n# Examine the full RelationalDistillationStrategy.cs file to understand amortization logic\nfd -t f \"RelationalDistillationStrategy.cs\" -x cat {}\n```\n\nLength of output: 38351\n\n---\n\n🏁 Script executed:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\n# Search for usages of RelationalDistillationStrategy and calls to ComputeLoss/ComputeGradient\n# to understand the execution order and trainer integration\nrg -n \"RelationalDistillationStrategy|ComputeLoss|ComputeGradient\" --type cs -B2 -A2 | head -100\n```\n\nLength of output: 9504\n\n---\n\n</parameter>\n</invoke>\n\n---\n\n🏁 Script executed:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\n# Search for trainer integration and Reset() calls\nfd -t f \"*.cs\" -x rg -l \"Reset\\(\\)\" {} \\; | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo \"=== {} ===\" && rg -n \"Reset|ComputeLoss|ComputeGradient\" -B3 -A3 {}'\n```\n\nLength of output: 283\n\n---\n\n🏁 Script executed:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\n# Search for Reset() calls and usage patterns\nrg -n \"\\.Reset\\(\\)\" --type cs -B5 -A5\n```\n\nLength of output: 13009\n\n---\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n**Relational loss and gradients are indeed misaligned between batch computation and sample application**\n\nThe review concern is valid. Here's the verified issue:\n\n**Execution Timeline (batch_size=32):**\n- **Samples 0-31:** Accumulated in buffers. When 31st sample added, relational loss computed on batch[0..31], then buffers cleared.\n- **Sample 31's gradient:** Cannot use Path 1 in `ComputeGradient` (buffers empty after `ComputeLoss`), so it gets zero relational gradient or stale cached gradient.\n- **Samples 32-63:** Receive amortized relational gradient computed from batch[0..31]—not from samples that contribute to *their* relationships.\n\nThis causes:\n1. **Temporal misalignment:** Samples forming a batch don't uniformly receive their own relational loss signal.\n2. **Cross-batch leakage:** Relational knowledge from batch N applied to batch N+1.\n3. **Weakened RKD signal:** Loss-gradient consistency is broken; the gradient doesn't match the sample that incurred the loss.\n\nThe `Reset()` call at epoch boundaries (verified in `KnowledgeDistillationTrainerBase.cs:570`) flushes partial batches but doesn't address the within-epoch misalignment.\n\n**Recommendation from original review remains sound:** Cache per-sample relational gradients (array, not average) and apply them to the exact samples that computed the batch, or refactor to batch-level API.\n\n<!-- fingerprinting:phantom:poseidon:chinchilla -->\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by CodeRabbit -->"}]}},{"id":"PRRT_kwDOKSXUF85huXS1","isResolved":true,"comments":{"nodes":[{"path":"src/KnowledgeDistillation/TeacherModelFactory.cs","line":169,"body":"_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🔴 Critical_\n\n**Stop wiring the online teacher with a no-op updater.**\n\n`CreateOnlineTeacher` still passes `(pred, target) => { }` into `OnlineTeacherModel`.
