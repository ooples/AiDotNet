    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_AMSGrad"><code>AMSGrad = 18</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Variant of Adam that maintains the maximum of past squared gradients for better convergence.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> AMSGrad is a variation of Adam designed to fix a potential convergence issue in the 
original algorithm. It keeps track of the maximum of all past squared gradients rather than just their 
exponential average. This ensures the learning rates never increase unexpectedly, which can help reach 
the optimal solution more reliably. It's like a hiker who remembers the steepest slope they've ever 
encountered in each direction and uses that information to make sure they never take too large a step, 
even if the current terrain appears gentle.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_AdaDelta"><code>AdaDelta = 37</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Extension of Adagrad that uses a moving average of squared gradients to adapt the learning rate.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> AdaDelta is an advanced optimizer that improves upon AdaGrad by addressing its
diminishing learning rates problem. Instead of accumulating all past squared gradients, AdaDelta uses
a moving window of gradients, remembering only recent history. What makes AdaDelta special is that it
doesn't even require setting an initial learning rate - it adapts automatically based on the relationship
between parameter updates and gradients. It's like a hiker who adjusts their pace not just based on the
steepness of the terrain, but also on how efficiently they've been covering ground recently. This makes
AdaDelta particularly robust across different types of problems without requiring manual tuning.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_AdaGrad"><code>AdaGrad = 35</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Adaptive gradient algorithm that accumulates squared gradients to scale the learning rate.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> AdaGrad adapts the learning rate individually for each parameter based on its 
historical gradient values. Parameters that receive large or frequent updates get smaller learning rates, 
while parameters with small or infrequent updates get larger learning rates. It's like a hiker who takes 
smaller steps on well-trodden, steep paths and larger steps on rarely visited, flat terrain. This makes 
AdaGrad particularly useful for dealing with sparse data, but its continually decreasing learning rates 
can sometimes cause learning to stop too early on complex problems.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_AdaMax"><code>AdaMax = 36</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Variant of Adam that uses the infinity norm for more stable updates.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> AdaMax is a variation of the Adam optimizer that uses the maximum (infinity norm) 
of past gradients rather than their squared values. This makes it more robust to gradient outliers and 
extreme values. It's like a hiker who pays attention to the steepest slope they've ever encountered in 
each direction, rather than the average steepness. This can make AdaMax more stable in some situations, 
particularly when gradients can vary widely in magnitude, though it may be less responsive to recent 
changes compared to Adam.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_Adadelta"><code>Adadelta = 11</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Extension of Adagrad that uses a different approach to address the diminishing learning rates problem.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Adadelta is another solution to Adagrad's diminishing learning rates, but it 
goes a step further than RMSprop. It not only tracks a moving average of past squared gradients but 
also maintains a moving average of past parameter updates. This allows it to continue learning even
when the gradients become very small. Adadelta is unique because it doesn't even require setting an
initial learning rate - it's like a hiker who can naturally adjust their pace based on both the 
terrain and their own recent energy expenditure.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_Adagrad"><code>Adagrad = 9</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Adaptive learning rate method that scales learning rates individually for each parameter.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Adagrad adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on how frequently
it's been updated. Imagine having different step sizes for different terrains - taking smaller steps 
on well-explored paths and larger steps in new areas. This works well for sparse data (where many 
features are rarely seen) but can cause the learning rate to become too small over time as it 
continuously shrinks, eventually making learning too slow.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_Adam"><code>Adam = 0</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Adaptive Moment Estimation - combines the benefits of momentum and RMSProp optimizers.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Adam is currently one of the most popular optimizers because it works well for many 
different types of problems. It's like a smart hiker who remembers both the general direction they've 
been moving (momentum) and adjusts their step size based on the terrain (adaptive learning rates). 
This makes it good at navigating both steep and flat areas efficiently. Adam is often a good default 
choice if you're not sure which optimizer to use.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_AdamOptimizer"><code>AdamOptimizer = 33</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Combination of adaptive learning rates and momentum for efficient optimization.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> The Adam Optimizer (Adaptive Moment Estimation) combines ideas from several other 
optimizers to achieve good results across many different problems. It keeps track of both the average 
gradient (first moment) and the average squared gradient (second moment) for each parameter, using these 
to adapt the learning rate individually. It's like a hiker who remembers both the general direction they've 
been moving and how variable or steep the terrain has been, adjusting their pace accordingly for each part 
of the journey.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_AdamW"><code>AdamW = 14</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Variant of Adam that implements a decoupled weight decay for better generalization.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> AdamW improves on Adam by handling weight decay (a technique to prevent overfitting) 
in a more effective way. Regular Adam applies weight decay to the already-adapted gradients, which can
make it less effective. AdamW applies weight decay directly to the weights instead. This seemingly small
change leads to better generalization - like making sure your backpack stays light throughout your journey,
rather than only thinking about its weight when deciding how fast to walk. This helps the model perform 
better on new, unseen examples.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_Adamax"><code>Adamax = 12</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Variant of Adam that uses the infinity norm instead of the L2 norm.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Adamax is a variation of Adam that uses a different way to track past gradients. 
While Adam uses the average squared magnitude of past gradients, Adamax uses the maximum magnitude. 
This makes it more robust to extreme gradient values (outliers) and can be especially useful for 
problems where occasional large gradient spikes might throw off other optimizers. It's like focusing 
on the biggest obstacle you've encountered rather than the average difficulty of the terrain.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_AdaptiveGradient"><code>AdaptiveGradient = 31</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Adaptive gradient algorithm that maintains per-parameter learning rates.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Adaptive Gradient methods adjust the learning rate separately for each parameter 
based on historical gradient information. Parameters that receive consistent gradient updates get smaller 
learning rates, while rarely updated parameters get larger ones. This is like a hiker who takes careful, 
small steps on well-trodden paths but larger, exploratory steps in unfamiliar territory. This approach 
helps balance learning across all parameters, especially in problems with sparse features.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_AntColony"><code>AntColony = 3</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Nature-inspired algorithm based on the foraging behavior of ant colonies.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Ant Colony optimization mimics how ants find the shortest path to food. Ants leave chemical 
trails (pheromones) that other ants follow, with stronger trails on shorter paths. In AI, this translates to 
having multiple "agents" explore possible solutions and leave "markers" about how good each path is. Over time, 
the algorithm converges on efficient solutions by following the strongest markers. This works well for problems 
like finding optimal routes or sequences.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_BayesianOptimization"><code>BayesianOptimization = 23</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optimization approach that builds a probabilistic model of the objective function.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Bayesian Optimization is like a smart explorer who keeps a mental map of where 
treasure might be hidden. After each exploration, it updates its beliefs about where the best solutions 
are likely to be found. This makes it particularly efficient for expensive-to-evaluate functions, as it 
carefully chooses each evaluation point to maximize information gain. It's like deciding where to dig 
for gold based on all your previous findings, rather than digging randomly or following a fixed pattern.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_ConjugateGradient"><code>ConjugateGradient = 27</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optimization method that generates search directions that don't interfere with previous progress.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Conjugate Gradient is like finding paths through a valley that don't undo your 
previous progress. Regular gradient descent might zigzag inefficiently, but conjugate gradient ensures 
that each new direction doesn't interfere with optimization along previous directions. This makes it 
much more efficient, especially for problems with many parameters. It's like planning a hike where each 
leg of the journey makes steady progress toward the destination without backtracking.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_CoordinateDescent"><code>CoordinateDescent = 22</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optimization method that updates one parameter at a time while keeping others fixed.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Coordinate Descent is like adjusting the knobs on a complex machine one at a time. 
It focuses on a single parameter, finds the best value for it while keeping all other parameters fixed, 
then moves on to the next parameter. This cycle repeats until the solution stops improving. It's 
particularly effective for problems where different parameters don't strongly interact with each other, 
and it can be easier to understand and implement than more complex methods.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_CrossEntropy"><code>CrossEntropy = 29</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optimization method that generates random samples and selects the best performing ones.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Cross-Entropy Method works by generating random solutions, evaluating them, and 
then adjusting the probability distribution to make good solutions more likely in the next round. It's 
like a treasure hunt where you start by looking randomly, but gradually focus your search on areas where 
you've found valuable items. This method is particularly useful for problems with complex constraints or 
discrete variables, and it can handle noisy evaluations well.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_DifferentialEvolution"><code>DifferentialEvolution = 24</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Evolutionary algorithm that creates new solutions by combining existing ones.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Differential Evolution is like breeding plants to get better varieties. It maintains 
a population of solutions and creates new candidates by combining existing ones in clever ways. For each 
solution, it creates a "child" by mixing parts of other solutions, and keeps the better one for the next 
generation. This approach is particularly good at exploring complex landscapes with many local optima, 
as it can jump to entirely different regions of the solution space.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_EvolutionaryAlgorithm"><code>EvolutionaryAlgorithm = 32</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Evolutionary algorithm that uses principles of natural selection to optimize solutions.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Evolutionary Algorithms mimic biological evolution to find optimal solutions. 
They maintain a population of candidate solutions, select the fittest ones based on performance, 
create new solutions through crossover (combining parts of existing solutions) and mutation (random changes), 
and repeat this process over generations. It's like breeding animals for desired traits - over time, 
the population evolves toward better solutions. This approach works well for complex problems where 
traditional methods might get stuck.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_FTRL"><code>FTRL = 17</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Online learning algorithm that adapts to the data characteristics.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> FTRL (Follow The Regularized Leader) is specialized for online learning scenarios, 
where data comes in a continuous stream rather than as a fixed dataset. It's particularly good at creating 
sparse models (models where many parameters become exactly zero), which is useful when you have many 
potentially relevant features but suspect only a few matter. FTRL is like a traveler who not only adapts 
their path based on new information but also knows when to completely ignore certain routes as irrelevant, 
creating a simpler, more efficient journey map.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_GeneticAlgorithm"><code>GeneticAlgorithm = 4</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Evolutionary algorithm inspired by natural selection and genetics.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Genetic Algorithms work like evolution in nature. They start with multiple random solutions 
(the "population") and then:
1. Evaluate how good each solution is (survival fitness)
2. Select the best solutions to "reproduce" (selection)
3. Create new solutions by mixing parts of good solutions (crossover)
4. Occasionally make random changes (mutation)
<p>Over many generations, good solutions emerge and get better. This is useful when you have complex problems
with many possible solutions and no clear mathematical approach.</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_GradientDescent"><code>GradientDescent = 1</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Classic optimization algorithm that updates parameters in the direction of steepest descent.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Gradient Descent is like always walking directly downhill to find the lowest point in a valley. 
It looks at all your training data at once before taking each step. This makes it very precise but can be slow 
with large datasets. Imagine calculating the average direction from thousands of compass readings before taking 
a single step - accurate but time-consuming.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_HillClimbing"><code>HillClimbing = 28</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Simple optimization strategy that always moves in the direction of immediate improvement.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Hill Climbing is one of the simplest optimization strategies - it always moves in 
the direction that immediately improves the solution. It's like hiking uphill by always taking a step in 
the steepest direction. This works well for simple problems with a single peak, but it can easily get 
stuck on small hills (local maxima) instead of finding the highest mountain (global maximum). Despite 
its limitations, it's easy to understand and implement, making it a good starting point.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_LBFGS"><code>LBFGS = 16</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Second-order optimization method that approximates the Hessian matrix to accelerate convergence.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> LBFGS (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) is an advanced optimizer 
that uses information about the curvature of the error surface (not just the slope). While first-order 
methods like SGD only know which way is downhill, LBFGS also has an idea of how quickly the slope is 
changing in different directions. This is like having not just a compass but also a detailed topographic 
map. This makes it incredibly efficient for problems where evaluating the model is expensive, though it 
requires more memory and computation per step. It's typically used for smaller models or when high 
precision is needed.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_Lion"><code>Lion = 19</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optimization algorithm that combines the Lion optimizer with advanced activation techniques.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum) is a newer optimizer that works differently from 
traditional approaches. Instead of using the exact gradient values, it only looks at their signs (positive 
or negative) combined with a momentum-like update rule. This makes it computationally efficient and often 
provides good performance with less fine-tuning required. It's like a hiker who only cares about the 
general direction (up, down, left, right) rather than precisely how steep each part is, saving energy 
while still making good progress overall.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_Momentum"><code>Momentum = 7</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Gradient descent variant that adds a fraction of the previous update to the current one.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Momentum is like rolling a ball downhill. Once it starts moving in a direction, 
it tends to keep going that way. This helps the optimizer move faster in consistent directions and 
push through small bumps or plateaus that might otherwise slow it down. Think of it as having some 
inertia that helps you maintain progress even when the path briefly levels off or gets noisy.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_Nadam"><code>Nadam = 13</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Combination of Adam and Nesterov momentum for improved performance.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Nadam (Nesterov-accelerated Adam) combines the benefits of Adam with those of 
Nesterov momentum. It takes Adam's ability to adapt learning rates individually for each parameter
and adds Nesterov's "look-ahead" approach. This gives you both adaptive step sizes and better
directional awareness - like a hiker who not only adjusts their stride based on the terrain but
also scouts ahead before committing to a direction.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_NelderMead"><code>NelderMead = 21</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Direct search method that doesn't require gradient information.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Nelder-Mead is like exploring a landscape by setting up camp in multiple spots 
and then moving your camps based on where the terrain looks most promising. It doesn't need to calculate 
slopes (gradients) which makes it useful when those calculations are difficult or impossible. Instead, 
it compares the values at different points and gradually moves toward better areas by expanding, 
contracting, or reflecting its search pattern. It's particularly good for problems where calculating 
derivatives is expensive or not possible.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_NestedLearning"><code>NestedLearning = 38</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Nested Learning optimizer - a multi-level optimization paradigm for continual learning.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Nested Learning is a new paradigm from Google Research that treats ML models as
interconnected, multi-level learning problems optimized simultaneously. Unlike traditional optimizers
that update all parameters at the same rate, Nested Learning operates at multiple timescales - some
parameters update quickly (learning from immediate feedback) while others update slowly (learning
general patterns). It uses a Continuum Memory System (CMS) that maintains memories at different
frequencies, mimicking how the human brain has both short-term and long-term memory. This makes it
particularly good at continual learning - learning new tasks without forgetting old ones. It's like
having multiple learning strategies working together: one that quickly adapts to new situations,
another that slowly builds general knowledge, and others in between, all coordinating to prevent
"catastrophic forgetting" where learning new tasks destroys knowledge of old tasks.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_NesterovAcceleratedGradient"><code>NesterovAcceleratedGradient = 8</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Advanced variant of Momentum that looks ahead to where the current momentum would take it.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Nesterov Accelerated Gradient is like a runner who looks ahead to see what's coming. 
Regular momentum is good but can overshoot targets. Nesterov first takes a step in the direction of the 
previous momentum, then checks the gradient at that "peeked" position to make a correction. This 
"look-before-you-leap" approach gives better control when approaching the optimal solution, like slowing 
down when you see you're getting close to your destination.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_Normal"><code>Normal = 20</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Standard optimization approach with fixed learning rate.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Normal optimization refers to a basic approach with a fixed learning rate (step size). 
It's like walking with the same stride length regardless of the terrain. This simplicity makes it easy 
to understand and implement, but it may not adapt well to different parts of the learning process. It's 
often used as a baseline or in simpler problems where adaptive techniques aren't necessary.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_NormalOptimizer"><code>NormalOptimizer = 34</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optimizer that combines random search with adaptive parameter tuning.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> The Normal Optimizer uses a combination of random exploration and adaptive learning 
to find good solutions efficiently. It starts with random guesses, learns from each attempt, and gradually 
refines its approach. It's like a treasure hunter who begins by searching in random locations but becomes 
more strategic as they gather clues about where the treasure might be. This balanced approach makes it 
versatile for many different types of problems.
</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_ParticleSwarm"><code>ParticleSwarm = 6</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds or fish.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Particle Swarm optimization mimics how birds flock or fish school. Imagine multiple explorers 
searching for treasure, each remembering the best spot they've personally found and also knowing the best spot 
anyone in the group has found. Each explorer moves based on both their own experience and the group's knowledge. 
This balance between individual exploration and group knowledge helps find good solutions efficiently, especially 
for problems with many variables to optimize.

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_PowellMethod"><code>PowellMethod = 30</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optimization method that performs sequential line minimizations along conjugate directions.</p>

<b>For Beginners:</b> Powell's Method searches along carefully chosen directions one at a time, finding 
the best point along each direction before moving to the next. After each complete cycle, it updates its 
search directions based on the progress made. This approach doesn't require calculating gradients, making 
it useful when those calculations are difficult. It's like exploring a maze by following one corridor at 
a time to its best point before trying a different corridor.

    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_QuasiNewton"><code>QuasiNewton = 26</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optimization method that approximates second-order information for better search directions.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Quasi-Newton methods are like having a partial map of the terrain that gets better 
as you explore. They approximate information about how the slope changes (curvature) without explicitly 
calculating it, which would be expensive. This gives them many of the benefits of second-order methods 
like Newton's method, but with much less computation. It's like learning the shape of a valley as you 
walk through it, helping you take more intelligent steps toward the lowest point.

    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_RAdam"><code>RAdam = 15</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Variant of Adam that rectifies the variance of the adaptive learning rate.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> RAdam (Rectified Adam) addresses a technical problem with Adam in the early stages 
of training when there isn't enough data to reliably estimate the adaptive learning rates. RAdam starts 
with a more conservative approach and gradually increases its adaptivity as training progresses. It's like 
a cautious explorer who starts with careful, measured steps in unfamiliar territory but becomes more 
confident and efficient as they gather more information about the landscape.

    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_RMSProp"><code>RMSProp = 10</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Extension of Adagrad that addresses the diminishing learning rates problem.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an improvement on Adagrad that solves 
the problem of the continuously shrinking learning rate. Instead of accumulating all past gradients, 
it only considers recent ones using a moving average. It's like focusing on your recent navigation 
history rather than every step you've ever taken. This prevents the step size from becoming too tiny 
and helps maintain a reasonable pace throughout the learning process.

    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_SimulatedAnnealing"><code>SimulatedAnnealing = 5</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Probabilistic technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Simulated Annealing is inspired by how metals cool. When hot, atoms move around freely; 
as they cool, they settle into a stable structure. This optimizer starts with big, sometimes random changes 
(high temperature) and gradually makes more careful, refined changes (cooling down). This helps it avoid 
getting stuck in suboptimal solutions early on. It's like first exploring broadly across a landscape, then 
gradually focusing your search in promising areas as you learn more.

    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_StochasticGradientDescent"><code>StochasticGradientDescent = 2</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Variant of gradient descent that uses random subsets of data for each update.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is like taking quick steps based on limited information. 
Instead of looking at all your training data before each step (which is slow), SGD looks at just one example 
or a small batch. This makes it much faster but a bit less precise - like quickly changing direction based on 
whatever you see right in front of you. It's faster but can take a more zigzag path to the solution.

    <dt id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_TrustRegion"><code>TrustRegion = 25</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optimization method that uses a simplified model within a trusted region.</p>
<p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Trust Region methods are like exploring with a map that's only accurate within a 
certain distance of your current position. The optimizer creates a simplified model of the landscape 
around the current point, solves that simpler problem, then decides how much to trust that model based 
on how well its predictions match reality. If the model works well, the "trusted region" expands; if not, 
it contracts. This cautious approach helps navigate difficult optimization landscapes reliably.

  <h2 id="AiDotNet_Enums_OptimizerType_remarks">Remarks</h2>
  <div class="markdown level0 remarks"><p>
<b>For Beginners:</b> Optimizers are like the "learning strategy" for AI models. When an AI model is learning, 
it needs to find the best values for its internal settings (called parameters or weights). Optimizers 
are different methods for finding these best values efficiently. Think of them as different strategies 
for climbing a mountain to reach the peak - some take small careful steps, others take bigger leaps, 
and some use special techniques to avoid getting stuck on small hills before reaching the highest peak.
