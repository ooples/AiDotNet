  <h2 id="AiDotNet_Enums_WaveletType_remarks">Remarks</h2>
  <div class="markdown level0 remarks"><p><b>For Beginners:</b> Wavelets are mathematical functions that cut up data into different frequency components.</p>
<p>Think of wavelets like special lenses that let you look at your data in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can zoom in to see fine details (high frequencies)</li>
<li>They can zoom out to see the big picture (low frequencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>Biorthogonal wavelets (Bior) are a special family of wavelets that have useful properties for
signal processing. The &quot;Reverse&quot; prefix indicates these are the reconstruction filters.</p>
<p>The numbers in each wavelet name (like &quot;11&quot; in ReverseBior11) represent:</p>
<ul>
<li>First number: Decomposition filter length</li>
<li>Second number: Reconstruction filter length</li>
</ul>
<p>Different wavelets are better suited for different types of data and applications.</p>
