</h2>
  <dl class="parameters">
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_C"><code>C = 6</code></dt>
  <dd><p>C programming language.</p>
<p>
C is a low-level language that provides fine-grained control over computer resources.
It's used for operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> C is a foundational language that's close to how computers work.
<p>Many other languages are based on C. It's used for operating systems and programs
that need direct control over computer hardware.</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_CPlusPlus"><code>CPlusPlus = 5</code></dt>
  <dd><p>C++ programming language.</p>
<p>
C++ is a powerful, high-performance language used for system software, game engines,
and applications where speed is critical. It provides low-level control while supporting
high-level abstractions.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> C++ is known for speed and control over computer resources.
<p>It's used when performance is critical, like in game engines, operating systems,
and high-frequency trading systems. It's more complex but very powerful.</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_CSharp"><code>CSharp = 1</code></dt>
  <dd><p>C# programming language.</p>
<p>
C# is a modern, object-oriented language developed by Microsoft. It's used for
Windows applications, game development (Unity), web services, and enterprise software.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> C# is a powerful language used for many types of applications.
<p>It's particularly popular for Windows programs, games (especially with Unity),
and business applications. It has strong typing which helps catch errors early.</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_Generic"><code>Generic = 10</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Generic or language-agnostic representation.</p>
<p>
This option is used when working with abstract program representations that aren't
tied to a specific programming language, or when the language is not yet determined.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> Generic means not specific to any one language.
<p>Sometimes you want to work with the logic of a program without worrying about
which language it will eventually be written in. This option represents that.</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_Go"><code>Go = 7</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Go (Golang) programming language.</p>
<p>
Go is a modern language designed at Google for building scalable network services
and concurrent applications. It emphasizes simplicity and has built-in concurrency support.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> Go is designed for building fast, reliable network services.
<p>It's simpler than some languages but still powerful, especially good for programs
that need to do many things at once (like web servers handling many users).</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_Java"><code>Java = 2</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Java programming language.</p>
<p>
Java is a widely-used, object-oriented language known for its "write once, run anywhere"
philosophy. It's popular for enterprise applications, Android development, and large-scale systems.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> Java is one of the most popular languages in the world.
<p>It's used for Android apps, large business systems, and web applications. Code written
in Java can run on different types of computers without modification.</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_JavaScript"><code>JavaScript = 3</code></dt>
  <dd><p>JavaScript programming language.</p>
<p>
JavaScript is the primary language for web browser programming and has expanded to
server-side development (Node.js). It's essential for interactive web applications
and is one of the most widely used languages.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> JavaScript makes websites interactive and dynamic.
<p>It runs in web browsers and powers most of the interactive features you see on websites.
It's also used for server-side programming and mobile app development.</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_Python"><code>Python = 0</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Python programming language.</p>
<p>
Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its readability and extensive
ecosystem. It's widely used in data science, machine learning, web development,
and automation.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> Python is known for being easy to read and beginner-friendly.
<p>It's popular for AI, data analysis, and general programming. Code looks clean and
is relatively easy to understand, making it a great choice for many applications.</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_Rust"><code>Rust = 8</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Rust programming language.</p>
<p>
Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, concurrency, and performance.
It prevents many common bugs through its unique ownership system.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> Rust helps you write safe and fast programs.
<p>It has special rules that prevent common programming errors (like memory bugs)
while still being very fast. Popular for system programming and security-critical applications.</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_SQL"><code>SQL = 9</code></dt>
  <dd><p>SQL (Structured Query Language) for database operations.</p>
<p>
SQL is a domain-specific language for managing and querying relational databases.
It's essential for data manipulation and retrieval in database systems.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> SQL is for working with databases.
<p>It's not a general programming language but a specialized language for storing,
retrieving, and managing data in databases. Used everywhere data is stored.</p>

</dd>
  
    <dt id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_TypeScript"><code>TypeScript = 4</code></dt>
  <dd><p>TypeScript programming language.</p>
<p>
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps catch
errors during development and is increasingly popular for large JavaScript applications.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> TypeScript is JavaScript with extra type checking.
<p>It helps prevent bugs by checking your code before it runs. Think of it as JavaScript
with helpful guardrails that catch mistakes early.</p>

  <h2 id="AiDotNet_ProgramSynthesis_Enums_ProgramLanguage_remarks">Remarks</h2>
  <div class="markdown level0 remarks"><p>
This enumeration specifies the target programming languages for code synthesis,
translation, and analysis tasks. Each language has its own syntax, semantics,
and typical use cases.
</p>
<p><b>For Beginners:</b> This lists the different programming languages the system can work with.
<p>Just like human languages (English, Spanish, French), there are many programming languages
(Python, C#, Java). Each has its own rules and is better suited for different tasks.
This enum helps the system know which language you want to work with.</p>
