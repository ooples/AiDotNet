/// The SQRBF activation function is defined as f(x) = exp(-ß * x²), where ß is a parameter that controls
/// the width of the Gaussian bell curve. This function outputs values between 0 and 1, with the maximum value

/// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Squared Radial Basis Function (SQRBF) is an activation function that produces a bell-shaped curve.
/// Unlike functions like ReLU or Sigmoid that are used in standard neural networks, SQRBF is commonly used in 
/// Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs).
/// 
/// Think of SQRBF like a "proximity detector" - it gives its highest output (1.0) when the input is exactly 0,
/// and progressively smaller outputs as the input moves away from 0 in either direction (positive or negative).
/// The ß parameter controls how quickly the output drops off as you move away from 0:
/// - A larger ß makes the bell curve narrower (drops off quickly)
/// - A smaller ß makes the bell curve wider (drops off slowly)
/// 
/// This is useful in machine learning when you want to measure how close an input is to a specific reference point.
