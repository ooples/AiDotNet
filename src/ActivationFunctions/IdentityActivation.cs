/// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Identity activation function is the simplest activation function - it returns exactly what you give it.
/// 
/// When you pass a value through this function:
/// - Input of 2 ? Output of 2
/// - Input of -3.5 ? Output of -3.5
/// - And so on...
/// 
/// Think of it like a straight line on a graph where y = x.
/// 
/// While most neural networks use non-linear activation functions (like ReLU or Sigmoid) to model complex patterns,
/// the Identity function can be useful in:
/// - The output layer of regression problems (when predicting continuous values)
/// - Testing or debugging neural networks
/// - Certain network architectures where you want values to pass through unchanged
