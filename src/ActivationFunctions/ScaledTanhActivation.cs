/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Scaled Tanh activation function is a parameterized version of the standard
/// hyperbolic tangent function. Like the standard tanh, it outputs values between -1 and 1, making
/// it useful for neural networks where you want the output to be centered around zero.
/// 
/// The mathematical formula is: f(x) = (1 - e^(-ßx)) / (1 + e^(-ßx))
/// 
/// This is equivalent to the standard tanh function when ß = 2, and has these key properties:
/// - Outputs values between -1 and 1
/// - Is symmetric around the origin (f(-x) = -f(x))
/// - The parameter ß (beta) controls the steepness of the curve
/// - When ß = 2, this is exactly equivalent to the standard tanh function
/// 
/// When to use it:
/// - When you need outputs centered around zero
/// - For hidden layers in many types of neural networks
/// - When dealing with data that naturally has both positive and negative values
/// - When you want to control the steepness of the activation function
