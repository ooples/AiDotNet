/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric data type used for calculations.</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Softmin function takes a vector of real numbers and transforms it into a probability distribution
/// that emphasizes smaller values. It's defined as: softmin(x_i) = exp(-x_i) / sum(exp(-x_j)) for all j in the vector.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> While Softmax emphasizes the largest values in a vector, Softmin does the opposite - it gives
/// more weight to smaller values. Think of it as a "smooth minimum" function. For example, if you have scores
/// [5, 2, 8], Softmax would highlight 8 (the maximum), but Softmin would highlight 2 (the minimum).
/// 
/// Softmin is less commonly used than Softmax but can be useful in scenarios where you want to identify or
/// emphasize the smallest values in a set, such as finding the closest points in certain distance-based algorithms
/// or when you want to assign higher probabilities to smaller values.
/// 
/// Like Softmax, Softmin outputs values between 0 and 1 that sum to 1, creating a probability distribution.
