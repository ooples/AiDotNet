/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> The ISRU (Inverse Square Root Unit) activation function is designed to:
/// 
/// - Keep the output values bounded (they never grow too large)
/// - Preserve the sign of the input (positive inputs give positive outputs, negative inputs give negative outputs)
/// - Allow gradients to flow more easily during training compared to some other functions
/// 
/// The function looks like an "S" shape that's been stretched horizontally, similar to tanh but with 
/// different mathematical properties. It approaches +1 for large positive inputs and -1 for large negative inputs,
/// but never quite reaches these values.
/// 
/// The a (alpha) parameter controls how quickly the function "saturates" (flattens out):
/// - Smaller a values make the function change more gradually
/// - Larger a values make the function change more abruptly
/// 
/// ISRU is useful in neural networks where you want bounded outputs but need to avoid the vanishing 
/// gradient problem that affects some other activation functions.
