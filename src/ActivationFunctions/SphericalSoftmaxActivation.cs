/// Spherical Softmax is a variation of the standard Softmax function that first normalizes the input vector
/// to have unit length (projects it onto the unit sphere) before applying the exponential and normalization steps.
/// This can help improve numerical stability and performance in certain neural network architectures.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Spherical Softmax is a special version of the Softmax function that's often used in the
/// output layer of neural networks for classification tasks. 
/// 
/// The standard Softmax converts a vector of numbers into probabilities that sum to 1, but it can sometimes
/// have numerical issues with very large or very small numbers. Spherical Softmax adds an extra step by first
/// "normalizing" the input vector (making its length equal to 1) before applying the regular Softmax steps.
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// 1. First, we adjust all the input values so that they form a point on a sphere with radius 1
/// 2. Then we apply the regular Softmax calculation to these adjusted values
/// 
/// This approach can make the neural network training more stable and sometimes leads to better performance,
/// especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or when the input values can vary widely in magnitude.

    /// The Spherical Softmax function performs the following steps:
    /// 1. Normalizes the input vector to have unit length (L2 norm = 1)

    /// <para>
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This method transforms a vector of numbers (like scores for different classes) into 
    /// probabilities that add up to 1. Here's how it works step by step:
    /// 
    /// 1. First, it calculates the "length" of the input vector (called the L2 norm)
    ///    - This is like finding the distance from the origin to a point in multi-dimensional space
    ///    - Mathematically, it's the square root of the sum of squares of all elements
    /// 
    /// 2. Then it divides each input value by this length
    ///    - This "normalizes" the vector so its length becomes exactly 1
    ///    - The direction of the vector stays the same, but its magnitude is now 1
    /// 
    /// 3. Next, it applies the exponential function (e^x) to each normalized value
    ///    - This makes all values positive and emphasizes larger values
    /// 
    /// 4. Finally, it divides each exponential value by the sum of all exponential values
    ///    - This ensures all values are between 0 and 1 and sum to exactly 1
    ///    - These values can now be interpreted as probabilities
    /// 
    /// The result is a probability distribution where higher input values get higher probabilities,
    /// but the initial normalization step helps prevent numerical issues that can occur with regular Softmax.

    /// It's used during the training process of neural networks to determine how to adjust the weights.

    /// The calculation has two main parts:
    /// 1. How the softmax output changes with respect to the normalized input
    /// 2. How the normalized input changes with respect to the original input

    /// For diagonal elements (when i=j):

    /// - term1: How one output changes when a different input increases
    /// - term2: How the normalization creates interdependencies between inputs
