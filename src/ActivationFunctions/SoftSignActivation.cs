/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The SoftSign function is defined as: f(x) = x / (1 + |x|), where |x| is the absolute value of x.
/// It maps any input value to an output between -1 and 1, similar to tanh but with different properties.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> SoftSign is an activation function that squeezes input values into a range between -1 and 1.
/// It's similar to the tanh function but approaches its limits more slowly.
/// 
/// Key properties of SoftSign:
/// - For input of 0, the output is 0
/// - For large positive inputs, the output approaches 1 (but never reaches it)
/// - For large negative inputs, the output approaches -1 (but never reaches it)
/// - The function is smooth everywhere, making it easier to train
/// - Unlike tanh, SoftSign has "polynomial" tails, meaning it approaches its limits more gradually
/// 
/// This gradual approach to limits can help prevent neurons from becoming "saturated" (stuck at extreme values)
/// during training, which can be an advantage in some neural network architectures.

    /// For example:
    /// - If input is 2, the output is 2/(1+2) = 2/3 ˜ 0.67
