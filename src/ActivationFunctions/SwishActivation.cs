/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Swish is a newer activation function developed by researchers at Google.
/// Its formula is x * sigmoid(x), which means it multiplies the input by the sigmoid of the input.
/// 
/// Key characteristics of Swish include:
/// - It's smooth everywhere, unlike ReLU which has a sharp corner at x=0
/// - It allows some negative values through, which can help with learning
/// - It behaves somewhat like ReLU for positive values, but has a smoother transition
/// - It has been shown to outperform ReLU in some deep neural networks
/// 
/// Swish combines some of the best properties of ReLU and sigmoid functions,
/// making it effective for many deep learning applications.
