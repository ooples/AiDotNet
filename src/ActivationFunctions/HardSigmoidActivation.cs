/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Hard Sigmoid is a simplified version of the standard Sigmoid function.
/// 
/// While the regular Sigmoid creates an S-shaped curve that smoothly transitions from 0 to 1,
/// the Hard Sigmoid uses straight lines to approximate this curve, making it:
/// 
/// 1. Computationally faster (uses simple math operations instead of exponentials)
/// 2. Less smooth but still useful for many neural network applications
/// 
/// The function works like this:
/// - If input = -1: output = 0
/// - If input = 1: output = 1
/// - If -1 &lt; input &lt; 1: output = (input + 1) / 2
/// 
/// This creates a straight line between (-1, 0) and (1, 1), with values clamped to the range [0, 1].
/// 
/// Hard Sigmoid is often used in mobile or embedded applications where computational
/// efficiency is important, or in certain types of recurrent neural networks.
