/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Taylor Softmax function is a variation of the standard Softmax function that uses a mathematical
/// technique called "Taylor series expansion" to approximate the exponential function. This makes it computationally
/// more efficient while maintaining similar behavior to the standard Softmax.
/// 
/// Softmax functions are commonly used in the output layer of neural networks for multi-class classification problems.
/// They convert a vector of numbers into a probability distribution (all values are positive and sum to 1).
/// 
/// For example, if you have three output neurons with values [2.0, 1.0, 0.5], the Softmax function will convert
/// these to probabilities like [0.6, 0.25, 0.15], which sum to 1.0. This makes it easy to interpret the outputs
/// as probabilities for each class.
/// 
/// The "Taylor" part refers to using a mathematical approximation (Taylor series) instead of calculating the
/// full exponential function, which can be faster but slightly less accurate.
