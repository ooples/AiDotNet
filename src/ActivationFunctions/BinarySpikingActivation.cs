/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Binary Spiking activation models how real neurons in your brain generate electrical pulses.
/// 
/// Unlike standard activation functions that output continuous values, Binary Spiking:
/// - Outputs only 1 (spike/fire) or 0 (no spike)
/// - Neurons "fire" only when their input exceeds a threshold
/// - After firing, neurons typically have a "refractory period" before they can fire again
/// 
/// This activation creates the discrete, all-or-nothing behavior of biological neurons:
/// - Input below threshold ? Output = 0 (neuron remains silent)
/// - Input at or above threshold ? Output = 1 (neuron fires a spike)
/// 
/// Common uses include:
/// - Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
/// - Neuromorphic computing systems
