/// Implements the Sparsemax activation function, which is an alternative to Softmax that can produce sparse probability distributions.

/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric data type used for calculations.</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Sparsemax maps input vectors to probability distributions, similar to Softmax, but with the key difference
/// that Sparsemax can assign exactly zero probability to low-scoring classes, creating sparse outputs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Sparsemax is an advanced activation function used primarily in the output layer of 
/// neural networks for classification tasks. While Softmax always gives some probability to every possible 
/// class (even if very small), Sparsemax can assign exactly zero probability to unlikely classes.
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// - Softmax is like saying "I'm 80% sure it's a dog, 15% sure it's a cat, and 5% sure it's something else"
/// - Sparsemax might say "I'm 90% sure it's a dog, 10% sure it's a cat, and 0% sure it's anything else"
/// 
/// This "sparsity" (having many zeros) can be useful when you have many possible classes but only a few
/// are likely to be correct. It makes the model's predictions more focused and interpretable.

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This method transforms a vector of numbers (like scores for different classes) into

    /// 
    /// 1. Sort all the input values from highest to lowest
    /// 2. Find a "threshold" value by checking when the running average becomes greater than the next value
    /// 3. Subtract this threshold from all input values
    /// 4. Set any negative results to zero

    /// The result is a probability distribution where:
    /// - Some values may be exactly zero (unlike Softmax where all values are positive)
    /// - All values add up to 1
    /// - Higher input values get higher probabilities
