/// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Thresholded ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is a variation of the standard ReLU activation function.
/// 
/// While a standard ReLU outputs the input value when it's positive and zero when it's negative (f(x) = max(0, x)),
/// the Thresholded ReLU adds an additional parameter called "theta" (?) that acts as a threshold.
/// 
/// The Thresholded ReLU only activates (returns the input value) when the input exceeds this threshold.
/// Otherwise, it returns zero. The formula is:
/// 
/// f(x) = x if x > ?, otherwise f(x) = 0
/// 
/// This allows the neural network to ignore small positive activations that might be noise, potentially
/// creating more robust models. By adjusting the threshold value, you can control how sensitive the
/// activation function is to input signals.
