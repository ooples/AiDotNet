/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> In AI and machine learning, a computational graph is like a recipe that shows how 
/// calculations flow from inputs to outputs. Each step in this recipe is called a "node".
/// 
/// Sometimes, we need to change these nodes - maybe we want to remove a step, add a new one, or change how a step works.
/// This class helps us keep track of what changes we want to make to which nodes.
/// 
/// Think of it like editing instructions in a recipe: you might want to replace one ingredient with another,
/// remove a step, or add a new technique. This class helps keep track of those edits before you apply them.
