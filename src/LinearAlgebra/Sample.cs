/// <summary>
/// Represents a single data sample consisting of features and a target value for machine learning algorithms.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="T">The data type of the target value and feature vector elements (e.g., float, double).</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Sample is like a single example that we use to train or test a machine learning model.
/// 
/// Think of it this way: if you were teaching someone to identify fruits, each Sample would be one fruit.
/// The "Features" would be the characteristics you observe (color, size, shape, texture),
/// and the "Target" would be the correct answer (apple, banana, orange).
/// 
/// For instance, in a house price prediction model:
/// - Features might include: number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood rating, etc.
/// - Target would be the actual price of the house
/// 
/// The machine learning algorithm learns from many of these samples to make predictions on new data.

    /// A Vector is simply a collection of numbers arranged in a specific order. In this case, each number
    /// in the vector represents a different feature or characteristic of our sample.

    /// - Features[0] might be the number of bedrooms
    /// - Features[1] might be the square footage
    /// - Features[2] might be the age of the house

    ///

    /// 
    /// For example:
    /// - In a house price prediction model, the target would be the actual price of the house.
    /// - In an email spam filter, the target would be whether the email is "spam" or "not spam".
    /// - In a medical diagnosis system, the target might be whether a patient has a certain condition.
    /// 
    /// After training, when we only have features (inputs) but don't know the target,
