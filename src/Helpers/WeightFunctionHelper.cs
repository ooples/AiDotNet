/// <b>For Beginners:</b> In standard regression, all data points are treated equally. However, in real-world data,
/// some points may be outliers (unusual values that don't follow the general pattern). Robust regression
/// techniques handle these outliers by assigning different "weights" to different data points.
/// 
/// Think of weights like importance scores:
/// - Normal data points get high weights (close to 1), meaning they have full influence on the model
/// - Outliers get low weights (close to 0), reducing their influence on the model
/// 
/// This helper class calculates these weights using different mathematical formulas (Huber, Bisquare, Andrews)
/// that determine how aggressively to downweight outliers.
