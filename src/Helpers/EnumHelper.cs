/// An enum (short for "enumeration") is a special type in programming that represents a set of 
/// named constants. Think of it like a predefined list of options.
/// 
/// For example, if you have an enum for DaysOfWeek, it might contain: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.
/// 
/// This helper class provides methods to get all the values from an enum, which can be useful when
/// you need to process all possible options or present them to a user.

    /// For example, if you have an enum for Colors (Red, Green, Blue), this method would return
    /// a list containing Red, Green, and Blue.
    /// 
    /// You can also choose to leave out one specific option by providing its name in the 'ignoreName' parameter.
    /// For instance, if you don't want 'Red' in your list, you could call:
    /// GetEnumValues&lt;Colors&gt;("Red")
    ///

    /// or when you need to process all enum values except for specific cases.
