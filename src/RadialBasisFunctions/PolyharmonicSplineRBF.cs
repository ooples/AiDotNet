/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of Polyharmonic Spline Radial Basis Functions, which are defined as:
/// f(r) = r^k for odd k
/// f(r) = r^k * log(r) for even k
/// where r is the radial distance and k is an integer parameter (typically k = 1).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Polyharmonic splines are used in scattered data interpolation, numerical solutions of partial differential
/// equations, and image processing. They are particularly useful for problems in multiple dimensions
/// due to their theoretical properties. Unlike many other RBFs, polyharmonic splines do not have a width
/// parameter, making them scale-invariant. The parameter k controls the smoothness of the resulting
/// interpolation, with higher values of k producing smoother functions.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Polyharmonic Spline RBF is used to create smooth curves or surfaces that pass through a set of points.
/// Think of it like drawing a smooth line through dots on a page, but it works in any number of dimensions.
/// 
/// This particular RBF comes in different "flavors" depending on the value of parameter k:
/// - When k is odd (1, 3, 5, etc.): The function is simply the distance raised to the power of k
/// - When k is even (2, 4, 6, etc.): The function is the distance raised to the power of k, multiplied by the logarithm of the distance
/// 
/// A unique property of polyharmonic splines is that they don't have a width parameter like most other RBFs.
/// This makes them "scale-invariant" - scaling all your input distances by the same factor only changes
/// the output by a constant factor, which doesn't affect the shape of the resulting interpolation.
/// 
/// Common choices for k include:
/// - k = 1: "Linear" (r)
/// - k = 2: "Thin plate spline" (r² log r)
/// - k = 3: "Cubic" (r³)
/// </para>
