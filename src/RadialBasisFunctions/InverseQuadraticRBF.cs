/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) that uses an inverse quadratic form
/// of f(r) = 1/(1 + (er)²), where r is the radial distance and e (epsilon) is a shape parameter
/// controlling the width of the function. The inverse quadratic RBF is infinitely differentiable and
/// decreases more slowly than the Gaussian RBF but faster than the inverse multiquadric RBF as distance increases.
/// It has properties that make it useful for scattered data interpolation and solving differential equations.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Inverse Quadratic RBF looks like a smooth bell-shaped curve that flattens out at larger distances.
/// At the center point (r = 0), it has its maximum value of 1, and as you move away from the center,
/// the function value gradually decreases toward zero, but never quite reaches it.
/// 
/// This RBF has a parameter called epsilon (e) that controls the shape and width of the function:
/// - A larger epsilon value creates a narrower bell curve that drops off quickly with distance
/// - A smaller epsilon value creates a wider bell curve that extends further
/// 
/// The inverse quadratic function is similar to the Gaussian RBF in shape but has "longer tails,"
/// meaning it decreases more slowly at larger distances. This property can be useful when you want
/// data points to have influence over a broader range.
