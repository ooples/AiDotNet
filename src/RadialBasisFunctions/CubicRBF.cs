/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) that uses a cubic function
/// of the form f(r) = (r/width)³, where r is the radial distance and width is a scaling parameter.
/// Unlike many other RBFs that decrease with distance, the cubic RBF increases with the cube of the distance.
/// This makes it useful for certain regression and interpolation problems where larger responses are expected
/// for points farther from the centers.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Cubic RBF is unique compared to many other RBFs because its value grows larger as you move
/// away from the center, rather than smaller. Specifically, it grows with the cube of the distance
/// (distance × distance × distance).
/// 
/// Think of it like a bowl shape turned upside down - the further you go from the center,
/// the higher the value becomes, and it grows quite rapidly with distance.
/// 
/// This type of function is useful in certain modeling scenarios where you expect larger values
/// for points that are farther away from reference points. The width parameter lets you control
/// how quickly the function grows with distance.
