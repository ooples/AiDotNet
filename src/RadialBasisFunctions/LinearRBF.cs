/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) that simply returns the radius itself.
/// Unlike most RBFs which reach their maximum at the center and decrease with distance, the Linear RBF
/// increases linearly with distance from the center. It has the simplest possible form of any RBF: f(r) = r.
/// Note that this function does not have a width parameter like most other RBFs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The Linear RBF can be useful in specific applications where a direct proportionality to distance is desired.
/// It is also sometimes used as a component in more complex kernels or in combination with other RBFs.
/// However, it should be noted that this function does not approach zero as distance increases, which may
/// make it unsuitable for many typical RBF applications requiring localized influence.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Linear RBF is the simplest possible RBF - it's just the distance itself. Think of it as a straight line
/// starting from zero at the center and growing uniformly as you move away in any direction.
/// 
/// This is different from most other RBFs because:
/// - Most RBFs have their highest value at the center and decrease with distance
/// - The Linear RBF starts at zero at the center and increases with distance
/// - Most RBFs have a "width" parameter to control how quickly they change with distance
/// - The Linear RBF has no width parameter - it always increases at the same rate
/// 
/// The Linear RBF is rarely used alone in practice, but it can be useful in certain specific applications
/// or as a building block for more complex functions.
