/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) that uses an exponential decay
/// of the form f(r) = exp(-e*r), where r is the radial distance and e (epsilon) is a width parameter
/// controlling how quickly the function decreases with distance. The exponential RBF is sometimes called
/// the Laplacian RBF and is related to the distribution of the same name. It decreases less rapidly than
/// the Gaussian RBF for small distances but has a more gradual asymptotic behavior for large distances.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Exponential RBF decreases as you move away from the center point, following an exponential decay pattern.
/// Think of it like a hill or mountain that starts at its highest point in the center and then gradually
/// slopes downward in all directions, never quite reaching zero.
/// 
/// This specific RBF has a parameter called epsilon (e) that controls how quickly the "hill" drops off:
/// - A larger epsilon value creates a steeper hill that drops off quickly with distance
/// - A smaller epsilon value creates a more gradual slope that extends further
/// 
/// The exponential RBF is useful in many machine learning applications, especially when you want a smoother
/// decrease with distance compared to a Gaussian RBF.
