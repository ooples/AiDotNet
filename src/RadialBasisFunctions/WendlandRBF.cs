/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of Wendland's family of compactly supported Radial Basis Functions.
/// These functions are defined by a smoothness parameter k and have the form:
/// - For k = 0: f(r) = (1 - r)²  (for r = 1, 0 otherwise)
/// - For k = 1: f(r) = (1 - r)4(1 + 4r)  (for r = 1, 0 otherwise)
/// - For k = 2: f(r) = (1 - r)6(3 + 18r + 35r²)  (for r = 1, 0 otherwise)
/// where r is the normalized radial distance (actual distance divided by the support radius).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Wendland functions are popular in scientific computing because they combine compact support
/// (they become exactly zero beyond a certain radius) with high order smoothness properties. The parameter k
/// controls the smoothness of the function: higher k values yield more derivatives at r = 0 and r = 1,
/// resulting in smoother interpolations. These functions are particularly useful for scattered data
/// interpolation, meshless methods for solving PDEs, and computer graphics applications.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// Wendland RBFs are a family of functions that have two important properties:
/// 1. They have "compact support" - they become exactly zero beyond a certain distance (the support radius)
/// 2. They are very smooth - they transition gradually to zero at the boundary with no sudden changes
/// 
/// Think of them like smooth hills or bumps that are exactly flat (zero) beyond a certain distance.
/// You can choose from different types of Wendland functions based on how smooth you need them to be:
/// - k = 0: The basic version, reasonably smooth but with limited continuity
/// - k = 1: A smoother version, with more continuous derivatives
/// - k = 2: The smoothest version, with even more continuous derivatives
/// 
/// The higher the k value, the smoother the function, but also the more computationally expensive.
/// These functions are particularly useful in scientific computing because they combine efficiency
/// (from the compact support) with high quality results (from the smoothness).
