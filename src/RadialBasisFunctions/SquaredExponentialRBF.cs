/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) that uses a squared exponential form
/// of f(r) = exp(-(er)²), where r is the radial distance and e (epsilon) is a shape parameter
/// controlling the width of the function. The squared exponential RBF, also known as the Gaussian RBF,
/// is one of the most widely used RBFs due to its smoothness properties. It is infinitely differentiable
/// and has exponential decay, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in machine learning,
/// interpolation, and function approximation.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The squared exponential RBF corresponds to a Gaussian probability distribution and has the unique
/// property of being a universal approximator, meaning it can approximate any continuous function to
/// arbitrary precision given sufficient basis functions. It is also the only RBF that is both rotation
/// and translation invariant.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Squared Exponential RBF, also commonly known as the Gaussian RBF, looks like a bell curve or
/// a mountain peak - it's at its highest at the center point (with a value of 1) and gradually decreases
/// in all directions, eventually approaching zero but never quite reaching it.
/// 
/// This RBF has a parameter called epsilon (e) that controls the width of the bell curve:
/// - A larger epsilon value creates a narrower bell curve that drops off quickly with distance
/// - A smaller epsilon value creates a wider bell curve that extends further
/// 
/// The squared exponential is the most popular RBF for many applications because:
/// - It's very smooth (it has derivatives of all orders)
/// - It has a simple mathematical form and properties
/// - Its shape resembles many natural processes and distributions
/// 
/// If you're familiar with statistics, it has the same shape as the Gaussian (normal) distribution
/// from probability theory.

    /// - Smaller epsilon values (like 0.1) make the bell curve very wide, decreasing slowly with distance
    /// 
    /// Think of it like adjusting the spread of a flashlight beam:
    /// - A high epsilon value is like a focused beam that covers a small area intensely
    /// - A low epsilon value is like a wide beam that covers a large area more diffusely

    /// If you're not sure what value to use, the default (epsilon = 1.0) is a good starting point
    /// that provides a moderate decrease with distance.
