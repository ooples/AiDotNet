/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) that uses a multiquadric form
/// of f(r) = v(r² + e²), where r is the radial distance and e (epsilon) is a shape parameter
/// controlling the width of the function. The multiquadric RBF is infinitely differentiable and
/// increases with distance, unlike many other RBFs that decrease with distance. It was introduced by
/// R.L. Hardy and is often used in scattered data interpolation and solving partial differential equations.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A notable property of the multiquadric RBF is that it grows with distance rather than decaying,
/// which can lead to better conditioning in certain interpolation problems. However, this growth also
/// means that the corresponding interpolation matrices can be ill-conditioned for large datasets unless
/// appropriate precautions are taken.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Multiquadric RBF is unusual compared to most other RBFs because its value grows larger as you move
/// away from the center, rather than smaller. It looks like a cone with a rounded bottom - starting from
/// a value of e at the center point (r = 0) and gradually increasing in all directions.
/// 
/// This RBF has a parameter called epsilon (e) that controls the shape of the function:
/// - A larger epsilon value creates a flatter, more rounded shape near the center
/// - A smaller epsilon value creates a sharper, more pointed shape near the center
/// 
/// The multiquadric function is useful in certain interpolation problems where its growth properties
/// can lead to better numerical stability. However, this same growth property means it's often used
/// in combination with other techniques when working with large datasets.
