/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) that uses a Gaussian form
/// of f(r) = exp(-e*r²), where r is the radial distance and e (epsilon) is a width parameter
/// controlling how quickly the function decreases with distance. The Gaussian RBF is one of the most
/// widely used RBFs due to its smooth behavior and mathematical properties. It is infinitely differentiable
/// and has exponential decay, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in machine learning,
/// interpolation, and function approximation.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Gaussian RBF is shaped like a bell curve or a mountain peak - it's at its highest at the center point
/// and gradually decreases in all directions, eventually approaching zero. This particular RBF is named
/// "Gaussian" because it uses the same mathematical form as the Gaussian (normal) distribution from statistics.
/// 
/// This RBF has a parameter called epsilon (e) that controls the width of the bell curve:
/// - A larger epsilon value creates a narrower bell curve that drops off quickly with distance
/// - A smaller epsilon value creates a wider bell curve that extends further
/// 
/// The Gaussian RBF is very popular in machine learning applications like neural networks and regression
/// because it has nice mathematical properties and creates smooth interpolations between data points.
