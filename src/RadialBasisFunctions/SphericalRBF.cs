/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Spherical Radial Basis Function, which is a compactly
/// supported RBF defined as:
/// f(r) = 1 - 1.5(r/e) + 0.5(r/e)³  for r = e
/// f(r) = 0                        for r > e
/// where r is the radial distance and e (epsilon) is a shape parameter controlling the support radius.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Unlike many other RBFs that have non-zero values for all distances, the Spherical RBF becomes exactly
/// zero beyond a certain radius (e), giving it "compact support." This property can be computationally
/// advantageous when working with large datasets, as it leads to sparse matrices in many applications.
/// The function is C² continuous, meaning it has continuous derivatives up to order 2.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Spherical RBF has a unique property compared to many other RBFs: it becomes exactly zero
/// beyond a certain distance (the support radius). Think of it like a hill that completely flattens
/// out beyond a specific distance - there's a clear boundary where the function's influence stops.
/// 
/// Inside its support radius, the function has a curved shape that smoothly transitions to zero at the boundary:
/// - At the center (distance = 0), the value is exactly 1
/// - As distance increases, the value decreases in a curved pattern
/// - At exactly the support radius (epsilon), the value becomes 0
/// - Beyond the support radius, the value stays at 0
/// 
/// This "limited reach" property makes the Spherical RBF computationally efficient for large datasets,
/// as points beyond the support radius can be completely ignored in calculations.
