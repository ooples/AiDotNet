/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) that uses a rational quadratic form
/// of f(r) = 1 - r²/(r² + e²), where r is the radial distance and e (epsilon) is a shape parameter
/// controlling the width of the function. The rational quadratic RBF is infinitely differentiable and
/// decreases from 1 at r = 0 to 0 as r approaches infinity. It has a smoother and more gradual decay
/// compared to the Gaussian RBF, which can be beneficial in certain applications.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This function forms a proper correlation function and has applications in various fields including
/// machine learning, geostatistics, and scattered data interpolation. The rational quadratic is also
/// related to the Student-t process in statistical modeling.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Rational Quadratic RBF is shaped like a hill or a bell curve - it starts at its highest point
/// in the center (with a value of 1) and gradually decreases in all directions, eventually approaching
/// zero but never quite reaching it. Compared to the Gaussian RBF, it decreases more slowly as you
/// move away from the center, giving it "fatter tails."
/// 
/// This RBF has a parameter called epsilon (e) that controls the width of the hill:
/// - A larger epsilon value creates a wider hill that decreases more gradually with distance
/// - A smaller epsilon value creates a narrower hill that drops off more quickly
/// 
/// The rational quadratic function is useful when you want a smooth function that doesn't decay
/// as rapidly as the Gaussian. It can capture longer-range dependencies in your data, making it
/// valuable in many machine learning and spatial statistics applications.
