/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) that uses an inverse multiquadric form
/// of f(r) = 1/v(r² + e²), where r is the radial distance and e (epsilon) is a shape parameter
/// controlling the width of the function. The inverse multiquadric RBF is infinitely differentiable and
/// decreases more slowly than the Gaussian RBF as distance increases. It is often used in interpolation
/// problems and has good numerical properties for solving partial differential equations.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Inverse Multiquadric RBF looks like an upside-down cone that flattens out at larger distances.
/// At the center point (r = 0), it has its highest value of 1/e, and as you move away from the center,
/// the function value gradually decreases toward zero, but never quite reaches it.
/// 
/// This RBF has a parameter called epsilon (e) that controls the shape and width of the function:
/// - A larger epsilon value creates a narrower peak with a faster initial drop-off
/// - A smaller epsilon value creates a broader peak with a more gradual initial drop-off
/// 
/// Unlike some other RBFs (like the Gaussian), the inverse multiquadric function has "long tails,"
/// meaning it decreases more slowly at larger distances. This property makes it useful for problems
/// where you want influence to extend further from the center points.
