/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) that uses a wave form
/// of f(r) = sin(er)/(er), where r is the radial distance and e (epsilon) is a shape parameter
/// controlling the frequency of oscillations. This function is also known as the spherical Bessel function
/// of the first kind of order zero, or more commonly as the "sinc" function when scaled.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Unlike most other RBFs that monotonically decrease with distance, the Wave RBF oscillates, creating
/// positive and negative lobes. This oscillatory behavior can be useful for modeling wave-like phenomena
/// or for approximating functions with periodic components. The function equals 1 at r = 0 and approaches 0
/// as r approaches infinity, but with oscillations that cross the zero axis.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Wave RBF is unique among RBFs because instead of simply decreasing with distance, it creates
/// a wave-like pattern that alternates between positive and negative values as you move away from
/// the center. Think of it like the ripples that spread out when you drop a stone in water - the
/// height of the water rises and falls in circles moving outward from where the stone hit.
/// 
/// This RBF has a parameter called epsilon (e) that controls how tightly packed these "ripples" are:
/// - A larger epsilon value creates more tightly packed ripples (higher frequency oscillations)
/// - A smaller epsilon value creates more widely spaced ripples (lower frequency oscillations)
/// 
/// The Wave RBF is particularly useful for modeling phenomena that naturally have wave-like properties,
/// such as sound, electromagnetic fields, or certain types of physical simulations.
