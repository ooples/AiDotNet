/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class provides an implementation of a Thin Plate Spline Radial Basis Function, which is defined as
/// f(r) = r² log(r), where r is the radial distance. This is a special case of the polyharmonic spline with k = 2.
/// The Thin Plate Spline RBF does not have a width parameter, making it scale-invariant.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The name "Thin Plate Spline" comes from the physical analogy of bending a thin sheet of metal. This RBF
/// minimizes a measure of energy that approximates the bending energy of a thin metal plate. It is particularly
/// useful for interpolation problems in two dimensions and provides a smooth interpolation that avoids
/// unnecessary oscillations.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Unlike many other RBFs, the thin plate spline grows with distance rather than decaying. At r = 0, the
/// function and its first derivative are both 0, providing a high degree of smoothness at the origin.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a special type of mathematical function
/// that depends only on the distance from a center point.
/// 
/// The Thin Plate Spline RBF is named after the physical behavior of a thin metal plate that bends
/// under pressure. Imagine pressing down on a thin sheet of metal at specific points - the way the
/// sheet bends to smoothly connect those points is similar to how this function behaves.
/// 
/// This RBF has some unique properties:
/// - Unlike most RBFs that decrease with distance, the thin plate spline actually grows as you move away from the center
/// - It equals exactly 0 at the center point (r = 0)
/// - It doesn't have a width parameter like most other RBFs, making it "scale-invariant"
/// - It creates very smooth interpolations with minimal unnecessary wiggles or oscillations
/// 
/// The thin plate spline is particularly useful for 2D interpolation problems, like reconstructing
/// a surface from a set of scattered points, or for image warping and morphing in computer graphics.
