/// <para>
/// This class provides functionality to identify and remove outliers from a dataset using the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method.
/// The MAD method is more robust to outliers than standard deviation-based approaches since it uses medians instead of means.
/// The algorithm calculates a modified Z-score for each data point and compares it against a threshold to determine if the point
/// is an outlier.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class helps you find and remove "unusual" data points from your dataset.
/// 
/// Imagine you have a collection of measurements, like people's heights. Most measurements will be clustered around
/// a typical value, but occasionally there might be mistakes or very unusual cases (like someone who is 9 feet tall).
/// These unusual values are called "outliers" and can negatively affect your analysis.
/// 
/// This class uses a technique called "Median Absolute Deviation" (MAD) to identify outliers:
/// - It finds the middle value (median) of your data
/// - It calculates how far each point is from this middle value
/// - It finds the middle value of these distances (the MAD)
/// - It calculates a score for each point that represents how unusual it is
/// - If this score is higher than a threshold, the point is considered an outlier
/// 
/// This approach is particularly good because it's not easily fooled by the outliers themselves,
/// unlike methods that use averages.

    /// Here's how it works:
    /// 1. It looks at each characteristic (column) of your data separately
    /// 2. For each characteristic, it:
    ///    - Finds the middle value (median)
    ///    - Measures how far each point is from this middle value
    ///    - Calculates a score that indicates how unusual each point is
    /// 3. If a data point has an unusually high score for ANY characteristic, it's considered an outlier
    /// 4. All outliers are removed, and the cleaned data is returned
    /// 
    /// For example, if you have data about houses with columns for size, price, and age, a house might
    /// be considered an outlier if it has a normal size and age but an extremely high price.
