/// This class provides functionality to identify and remove outliers from a dataset using the Z-Score method.
/// The Z-Score approach measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the dataset.
/// Points with a Z-Score exceeding a specified threshold are considered outliers. This method assumes that
/// the data follows a relatively normal distribution.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class helps you find and remove unusual data points from your dataset.
/// 
/// Imagine you collected height measurements for a group of people. Most heights will be close to the average,
/// but there might be a few very unusual values (like someone recorded as 10 feet tall), which could be errors
/// or just very rare cases.
/// 
/// The Z-Score method works like this:
/// - It calculates the average (mean) of all your data points
/// - It determines how spread out the data is (standard deviation)
/// - For each point, it calculates how far that point is from the average, in terms of standard deviations
/// - If a point is too far away (beyond the threshold you set), it's considered an outlier
/// 
/// For example, with a threshold of 3, any point more than 3 standard deviations from the mean would be
/// considered an outlier and removed from the dataset.

    /// The threshold parameter controls how sensitive the outlier detection is:
    /// - A lower threshold (like 2.0) will be more aggressive in labeling points as outliers
    /// - A higher threshold (like 4.0) will be more lenient, only marking very extreme values as outliers
    /// 
    /// In statistics, a threshold of 3 is commonly used, which means points that are more than 3 standard
    /// deviations away from the average are considered outliers. With a normal distribution, this would

    /// the inputs and outputs.

    /// Here's how it works:
    /// 1. It looks at each characteristic (column) of your data separately
    /// 2. For each characteristic, it:
    ///    - Calculates the average value
    ///    - Determines how spread out the values are (standard deviation)
    ///    - Computes a Z-Score for each point (how many standard deviations from the average)
    /// 3. If a data point has an unusually high or low Z-Score for ANY characteristic, it's considered an outlier
    /// 4. All outliers are removed, and the cleaned data is returned
    /// 
    /// For example, if you have data about houses with columns for size, price, and age, a house might
    /// be considered an outlier if it has a normal size and age but an extremely high price (high Z-Score for price).
