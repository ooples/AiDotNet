/// What this class does:
/// - Splits your data into outer folds for overall model assessment
/// - For each outer fold:
///   - Further splits the training data into inner folds for hyperparameter tuning
///   - Uses the inner folds to find the best hyperparameters
///   - Trains a model with the best hyperparameters on the full outer training set
///   - Evaluates this model on the outer test set
/// - Calculates how well your model performs on average across all outer folds
/// 
/// This is useful because:
/// - It helps you choose the best hyperparameters for your model
/// - It provides an unbiased estimate of your model's performance on new data
/// - It helps prevent overfitting during the model selection process
