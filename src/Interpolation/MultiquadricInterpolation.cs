/// Implements Multiquadric Radial Basis Function interpolation for two-dimensional data points.

/// <remarks>
/// Multiquadric interpolation is a powerful technique for creating smooth surfaces from scattered data points.
/// It uses radial basis functions centered at each data point to construct an interpolating surface.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Imagine you have several points with known heights (like mountains on a map),
/// and you want to estimate the height at any location between these points. Multiquadric interpolation
/// creates a smooth surface that passes exactly through all your known points while providing reasonable
/// estimates for all the areas in between. It's particularly good at handling irregularly spaced data points
/// and can create very smooth surfaces.
