/// <remarks>
/// Moving Least Squares (MLS) is a method for smoothly interpolating scattered data points
/// in two dimensions. It creates a continuous surface that passes through or near the original data points.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Imagine you have several points with known heights (like mountains on a map),
/// and you want to estimate the height at any location between these points. Moving Least Squares
/// creates a smooth surface that respects your known points while providing reasonable estimates
/// for all the areas in between. It's like creating a smooth terrain from a set of elevation measurements.
/// 
/// Unlike simpler methods, MLS adapts to the local density and arrangement of your data points,
/// giving more weight to nearby points when estimating a value at a specific location.
