/// Whittaker-Shannon interpolation is a technique based on the sampling theorem, which states that
/// a band-limited function can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling rate
/// is at least twice the highest frequency in the function.

/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Think of this interpolation like recreating a smooth curve from a series of dots.
/// Imagine you have a photograph that's been converted to a grid of pixels. This method helps you
/// "zoom in" between those pixels to create a smoother, higher-resolution image. It works best when
/// your data points are evenly spaced (like pixels in a digital image) and when the underlying pattern
/// doesn't contain frequencies that are too high (meaning the data doesn't wiggle up and down too rapidly).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This method is particularly useful for signal processing applications, such as audio or image processing,
/// where you need to reconstruct continuous signals from discrete samples.
