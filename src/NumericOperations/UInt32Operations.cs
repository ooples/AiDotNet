/// <para>
/// This class implements the <see cref="INumericOperations{T}"/> interface for the <see cref="uint"/> type,
/// providing basic and advanced mathematical operations while handling the limitations of the unsigned integer data type.
/// Since uint values are limited to the range 0 to 4,294,967,295, operations that would result in values
/// outside this range will overflow and potentially produce unexpected results.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class lets you perform math with unsigned integers (whole numbers between 0 and approximately 4.29 billion).
/// 
/// Think of it like a calculator that works specifically with positive whole numbers and zero. For example:
/// - You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide uint numbers
/// - You can compare values (is one number greater than another?)
/// - You can perform more advanced operations like square roots or exponents
/// 
/// However, be careful! If your calculations produce a number larger than 4,294,967,295 or a negative number,
/// the result will "wrap around" (overflow) and might give you an unexpected answer. This is like
/// a car odometer that rolls over to 0 after reaching its maximum value.
/// 
/// The main advantage of uint over other number types is that it can store large positive numbers
/// (up to about 4.29 billion) while using less memory than even larger number types like ulong.
