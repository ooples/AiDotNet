/// Think of it like a calculator that works specifically with positive whole numbers up to 65,535. For example:
/// - You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide ushort numbers
/// - You can compare values (is one number greater than another?)
/// - You can perform more advanced operations like square roots or exponents
/// 
/// However, be careful! If your calculations produce a number larger than 65,535 or a negative number,
/// the result will "wrap around" (overflow) and might give you an unexpected answer. This is like
/// a car odometer that rolls over to 0 after reaching its maximum value.
