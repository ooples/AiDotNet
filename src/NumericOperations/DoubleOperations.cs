/// This class implements the INumericOperations interface for the double data type, providing

/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class handles math operations for the double number type.

/// The double type in C# is designed for general-purpose calculations:
/// - It can represent very large numbers (up to approximately 1.8 × 10^308)
/// - It can represent very small numbers (down to approximately 5.0 × 10^-324)
/// - It stores decimal numbers with about 15-17 significant digits of precision
/// - It can represent special values like infinity and NaN (Not a Number)
///
/// However, doubles have some limitations:
/// - They can't represent all decimal fractions exactly (e.g., 0.1 + 0.2 doesn't equal exactly 0.3)
/// - They may introduce small rounding errors in calculations
///
/// Doubles are best used for scientific, engineering, or graphics calculations where high range
/// is more important than exact decimal representation.
