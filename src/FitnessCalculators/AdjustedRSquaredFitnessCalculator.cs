/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps you evaluate how well your model fits the data using 
/// a metric called "Adjusted R-Squared."
/// 
/// Regular R-Squared (also called the coefficient of determination) measures how well your model 
/// explains the variation in your data, ranging from 0 to 1:
/// - 0 means your model doesn't explain any of the variation
/// - 1 means your model perfectly explains all variation
/// 
/// However, regular R-Squared has a problem: it always increases when you add more features to your model,
/// even if those features don't actually help with predictions.
/// 
/// Adjusted R-Squared fixes this issue by penalizing models that use too many features. It's like
/// R-Squared with a built-in protection against overly complex models. This helps you find the
/// right balance between model complexity and accuracy.
/// 
/// Unlike regular R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared can be negative if your model performs very poorly.
/// Generally, you want this value to be as close to 1 as possible.
