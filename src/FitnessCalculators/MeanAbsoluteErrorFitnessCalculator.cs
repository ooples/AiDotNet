/// <summary>
/// A fitness calculator that uses Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate model performance, particularly for regression tasks.

/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric type used for calculations (e.g., double, float).</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps evaluate how well your model is performing on regression tasks
/// (where you're predicting continuous values like prices, temperatures, etc.) by measuring the average
/// size of the errors in your predictions without considering their direction.
/// 
/// Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is one of the simplest and most intuitive ways to measure prediction errors:
/// - It calculates the absolute difference between each prediction and the actual value
/// - It then takes the average of all these differences
/// - The result tells you, on average, how far off your predictions are
/// 
/// How MAE works:
/// - Take the difference between each predicted value and actual value
/// - Convert all differences to positive numbers (take the absolute value)
/// - Calculate the average of these absolute differences
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// Imagine you're predicting house prices:
/// - For one house, you predict $200,000 but the actual price is $220,000 (error of $20,000)
/// - For another house, you predict $350,000 but the actual price is $330,000 (error of $20,000)
/// - The MAE would be $20,000, telling you that on average, your predictions are off by $20,000
/// 
/// Key characteristics of MAE:
/// - It treats all errors equally (unlike Mean Squared Error which penalizes large errors more)
/// - It's measured in the same units as your original data (dollars, degrees, etc.)
/// - It's less sensitive to outliers than Mean Squared Error
/// - Lower values are better (0 would be perfect predictions)
/// 
/// Common applications include:
/// - Price prediction
/// - Temperature forecasting
/// - Any regression task where you want errors measured in the original units
/// - Situations where outliers should not have outsized influence

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This method calculates how well your model is performing using Mean Absolute Error.
    /// 
    /// It works by:
    /// 1. Taking the predictions your model made
    /// 2. Comparing them to the actual correct answers
    /// 3. Finding the absolute difference for each prediction (how far off, regardless of direction)
    /// 4. Taking the average of these absolute differences
    /// 
    /// A lower score means better performance (0 would be perfect).
    /// 
    /// The formula is: MAE = (1/n) * S|predicted - actual|

    /// 
    /// This method simply retrieves the pre-calculated MAE from the dataSet's ErrorStats property,
    /// which contains various error metrics that have already been computed.
    ///

    /// - You want to understand errors in the same units as your original data
