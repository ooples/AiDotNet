/// <remarks>

/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps evaluate how well your model is performing by measuring
/// the proportion of variance in your target variable that is explained by your model.
/// 
/// R-Squared (R²), also called the coefficient of determination, is:
/// - A measure of how well your model explains the variation in your data
/// - Expressed as a value typically between 0 and 1 (or 0% to 100%)
/// - A higher value means your model explains more of the variation in your data
/// 
/// How R-Squared works:
/// - R² = 1 means your model perfectly explains all the variation in your data
/// - R² = 0 means your model doesn't explain any of the variation (it's no better than just predicting the average)
/// - R² can sometimes be negative if your model performs worse than just predicting the average
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// Imagine you're predicting house prices:
/// - If R² = 0.7, it means 70% of the variation in house prices is explained by your model
/// - The remaining 30% is due to factors your model doesn't capture
/// 
/// A simple way to understand R²:
/// - If you always predicted the average house price, you'd have an R² of 0
/// - If you could predict every house price exactly right, you'd have an R² of 1
/// - Your model's R² tells you how much better it is than just predicting the average
/// 
/// Key characteristics of R²:
/// - Higher values are better (1 would be perfect)
/// - It's scale-independent (it doesn't matter if you're predicting dollars or millions of dollars)
/// - It helps you understand how much of the variation your model captures
/// - It can be misleading if you have a small sample size or too many features
/// 
/// When to use R²:
/// - When you want to know how much of the variation your model explains
/// - When you want a metric that's easy to interpret (0% to 100% explained)
/// - When comparing different models for the same problem
/// - For regression problems (predicting continuous values)
/// 
/// R² is one of the most popular metrics for regression tasks because it provides an
/// intuitive measure of how well your model captures the patterns in your data.
