/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps evaluate how well your model is performing on classification tasks
/// (where you're predicting categories or classes) by using a special loss function that's more robust
/// to outliers and noisy data than some alternatives.
/// 
/// Modified Huber Loss is a sophisticated loss function that combines the benefits of different approaches:
/// - For predictions that are very wrong, it increases linearly (like absolute error)
/// - For predictions that are moderately wrong, it increases quadratically (like squared error)
/// - This makes it less sensitive to outliers than squared error alone
/// 
/// How Modified Huber Loss works:
/// - It looks at how confident your model is in its predictions
/// - For predictions where the model is very wrong (far from the true value), it applies a gentler penalty
/// - For predictions where the model is somewhat wrong, it applies a stronger penalty
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// Imagine you're grading a test:
/// - If a student is completely wrong (guessing randomly), you don't want to penalize them too harshly
/// - If a student is somewhat wrong (they understood the concept but made a mistake), you want to provide stronger feedback
/// - Modified Huber Loss follows this intuition by adjusting the penalty based on how wrong the prediction is
/// 
/// Key characteristics of Modified Huber Loss:
/// - It's more robust to outliers and noisy data than squared loss
/// - It's smoother than Hinge Loss (another popular classification loss)
/// - It's particularly useful for binary classification problems
/// - Lower values are better (0 would be perfect predictions)
/// 
/// Common applications include:
/// - Binary classification tasks (yes/no predictions)
/// - Situations with potentially noisy or mislabeled data
/// - When you want a balance between robustness and mathematical convenience

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This method calculates how well your model is performing using Modified Huber Loss.
    /// 
    /// It works by:
    /// 1. Taking the predictions your model made
    /// 2. Comparing them to the actual correct answers
    /// 3. Applying a special formula that changes based on how wrong each prediction is:
    ///    - For predictions that are very wrong: applies a linear penalty
    ///    - For predictions that are moderately wrong: applies a quadratic penalty
    /// 4. Taking the average of these penalties
    /// 
    /// A lower score means better performance (0 would be perfect).
    /// 
    /// The formula is:
    /// - If z * y = -1: loss = max(0, 1 - z * y)²
    /// - If z * y < -1: loss = -4 * z * y
    /// where z is the prediction and y is the actual value.
    /// 
    /// This method calls the NeuralNetworkHelper's ModifiedHuberLoss method to perform the actual calculation,
    /// passing in the predicted and actual values from the dataset.
    /// 
    /// Modified Huber Loss is particularly useful when:
    /// - You're working with binary classification problems
    /// - You want a loss function that's less sensitive to outliers
    /// - You need a function that's differentiable everywhere (for optimization)
