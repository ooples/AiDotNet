/// <summary>
/// A fitness calculator that uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance, particularly for regression tasks.

/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric type used for calculations (e.g., double, float).</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps evaluate how well your model is performing on regression tasks
/// (where you're predicting continuous values like prices, temperatures, etc.) by measuring the average
/// of the squared differences between predictions and actual values.
/// 
/// Mean Squared Error (MSE) is one of the most commonly used metrics in machine learning:
/// - It calculates the square of the difference between each prediction and the actual value
/// - It then takes the average of all these squared differences
/// - The result tells you how large your errors are, with larger errors being penalized more heavily
/// 
/// How MSE works:
/// - Take the difference between each predicted value and actual value
/// - Square each difference (multiply it by itself)
/// - Calculate the average of these squared differences
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// Imagine you're predicting house prices:
/// - For one house, you predict $200,000 but the actual price is $220,000 (error of $20,000)
/// - For another house, you predict $350,000 but the actual price is $330,000 (error of $20,000)
/// - When squared, both errors become 400,000,000
/// - The MSE would be 400,000,000, which is much larger than the original error
/// 
/// Key characteristics of MSE:
/// - It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones (due to squaring)
/// - It's measured in squared units (e.g., squared dollars, squared degrees)
/// - It's more sensitive to outliers than Mean Absolute Error
/// - Lower values are better (0 would be perfect predictions)
/// 
/// Common applications include:
/// - Training many types of regression models
/// - Situations where large errors should be penalized more heavily
/// - When you want a differentiable loss function for optimization

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This method calculates how well your model is performing using Mean Squared Error.
    /// 
    /// It works by:
    /// 1. Taking the predictions your model made
    /// 2. Comparing them to the actual correct answers
    /// 3. Finding the difference for each prediction
    /// 4. Squaring each difference (which makes all values positive and emphasizes larger errors)
    /// 5. Taking the average of these squared differences
    /// 
    /// A lower score means better performance (0 would be perfect).
    /// 
    /// The formula is: MSE = (1/n) * S(predicted - actual)²
    /// where n is the number of predictions and S means "sum of".
    /// 
    /// This method simply retrieves the pre-calculated MSE from the dataSet's ErrorStats property,
    /// which contains various error metrics that have already been computed.
    /// 
    /// MSE is particularly useful when:
    /// - You want to penalize larger errors more heavily
    /// - You're using gradient-based optimization methods
    /// - You're working with models that assume normally distributed errors
    /// 
    /// Note that because of squaring, MSE is measured in squared units (e.g., if you're predicting
    /// dollars, MSE is in squared dollars). If you want an error metric in the original units,
    /// you might consider Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
