/// The NoNormalizer is a pass-through implementation that does not alter the input values.
/// It returns the original values unchanged while still conforming to the INormalizer interface.
/// This implementation is useful when normalization is optional in an algorithm, or when comparing
/// normalized and unnormalized results.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Use cases for NoNormalizer include:
/// - Testing the effects of normalization by comparing with non-normalized data
/// - Working with data that is already in an appropriate scale
/// - Algorithm implementations that make normalization optional
/// - Ensuring consistent interfaces across a system even when normalization isn't needed
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This normalizer doesn't actually normalize anything.
/// 
/// Think of NoNormalizer as a "do nothing" option:
/// - While other normalizers transform data to different scales
/// - This one simply passes the original values through unchanged
/// - It's like having a "raw" or "as is" option when processing data
/// 
/// This is useful when:
/// - You want to compare the effects of normalization versus no normalization
/// - Your data is already in a good range for your needs
/// - You're building a system where normalization is optional but the interface should be consistent
/// 
/// It's similar to having an "identity function" that returns exactly what you put into it.
