/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Extremely Randomized Trees (also known as Extra Trees) is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees
/// and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Unlike Random Forests, which use the best
/// split for each feature, Extra Trees selects random thresholds for each feature and chooses the best among these
/// random thresholds, adding an additional layer of randomization that can further reduce variance.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This model works like a committee of decision trees that vote on predictions.
/// 
/// While a single decision tree might make mistakes due to its specific structure, 
/// a group of different trees can work together to make more reliable predictions:
/// 
/// - Each tree sees a random subset of the training data
/// - Each tree uses random thresholds for making decisions
/// - The final prediction is the average of all individual tree predictions
/// 
/// The key advantage is that by adding extra randomness in how the trees are built,
/// the model avoids "memorizing" the training data and becomes better at generalizing
/// to new data. This is similar to how asking many different people for their opinion
/// often leads to better decisions than relying on just one person.
