/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Genetic Algorithm Regression uses evolutionary principles to find optimal model coefficients.
/// It maintains a population of potential solutions (models) that evolve over generations through
/// selection, crossover, and mutation operations. This approach is particularly useful for complex
/// problems where traditional optimization methods might struggle, as it can effectively explore
/// large solution spaces and avoid local optima.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This model uses a technique inspired by natural evolution to find the best solution.
/// 
/// Think of it like breeding the best solution:
/// - Start with a random "population" of potential solutions (different sets of coefficients)
/// - Test how well each solution performs on your data (fitness evaluation)
/// - Keep the best solutions and let them "reproduce" to create new solutions
/// - Occasionally introduce random changes (mutations) to explore new possibilities
/// - Repeat this process over multiple "generations" until you find an excellent solution
/// 
/// The benefit of this approach is that it can find good solutions to complex problems
/// without getting stuck in suboptimal answers. It's similar to how nature evolves
/// successful organisms over time, but applied to finding the best mathematical model.
