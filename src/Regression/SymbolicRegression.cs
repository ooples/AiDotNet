/// Symbolic regression works by:
/// - Creating a population of mathematical expressions (typically as expression trees)
/// - Evolving these expressions using genetic programming techniques
/// - Evaluating expressions based on how well they fit the data
/// - Selecting the best expressions to create new generations
/// - Eventually converging on an optimal or near-optimal mathematical model
/// 
/// This approach can discover complex, nonlinear relationships without requiring the user
/// to specify the form of the equation in advance.

/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Symbolic regression is like having an AI mathematician that invents formulas.
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// - Instead of you telling the computer what equation to use (like y = mx + b)
/// - The computer tries thousands of different formulas (like y = x�, y = sin(x), etc.)
/// - It tests each formula to see how well it predicts your data
/// - It combines good formulas to make even better ones
/// - Eventually, it finds a formula that best explains your data
/// 
/// For example, when modeling how a plant grows, instead of assuming it follows a linear or
/// exponential pattern, symbolic regression might discover it follows a pattern like
