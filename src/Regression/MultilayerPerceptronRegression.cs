/// <para>
/// The MultilayerPerceptronRegression is a neural network-based regression model that can capture complex non-linear
/// relationships between features and the target variable. It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers,
/// and an output layer, with each layer connected by weights and biases. The model learns by adjusting these weights
/// and biases through a process called backpropagation, minimizing the prediction error.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A multilayer perceptron is like a digital brain that can learn complex patterns.
/// 
/// Think of it as a system of interconnected layers:
/// - The input layer receives your data (like house features if predicting house prices)
/// - The hidden layers process this information through a series of mathematical transformations
/// - The output layer produces the final prediction (like the predicted house price)
/// 
/// Each connection between neurons has a "weight" (importance) that gets adjusted as the network learns.
/// For example, the network might learn that square footage has a bigger impact on house prices than
/// the age of the house, so it assigns a larger weight to that feature.
/// 
/// The network improves by comparing its predictions to actual values and adjusting the weights
/// to reduce the difference between them.
