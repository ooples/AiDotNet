/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression to incorporate multiple input features. It models the
/// relationship between several independent variables and one dependent variable by fitting a linear equation to the
/// observed data. The model assumes that the relationship between inputs and the output is linear, meaning that the output
/// can be calculated as a weighted sum of the input features plus a constant term (intercept).
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Multiple regression is like a formula that predicts one value based on several inputs.
/// 
/// Think of it like a house price calculator:
/// - You provide information like square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood rating, etc.
/// - Each feature has a certain importance (called a coefficient)
/// - The model combines all these factors with their importances to make a prediction
/// 
/// For example, the formula might be:
/// House Price = $50,000 + ($100 × Square Footage) + ($15,000 × Number of Bedrooms) + ($25,000 × Neighborhood Rating)
/// 
/// The model learns the best values for these coefficients from your training data to make accurate predictions.

    /// This method trains the multiple regression model using the normal equation approach, which finds the optimal
    /// coefficients by solving a system of linear equations. The normal equation is given by:
    /// coefficients = (X^T * X + regularization)^(-1) * X^T * y, where X^T is the transpose of the feature matrix X.
    /// This approach directly computes the optimal coefficients without requiring iterative optimization.
    /// </para>
    /// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This is where the model learns from your data.
    /// 
    /// During training:
    /// 1. If an intercept is used, an extra column of 1's is added to the input features
    /// 2. The model applies matrix operations to find the best coefficients
    /// 3. These coefficients determine how much each feature contributes to the prediction
    /// 
    /// Unlike some other models that learn gradually through many iterations, multiple regression
    /// finds the optimal solution in one step by solving a system of equations.
    /// 
    /// For example, the model might learn that for house prices:
    /// - Each additional square foot adds $100 to the price
    /// - Each bedroom adds $15,000 to the price 
    /// - Each point in neighborhood rating adds $25,000 to the price
