/// <para>
/// Multivariate linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between multiple independent
/// variables and a dependent variable by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The model assumes that the
/// relationship between inputs and the output is linear, meaning that the output can be calculated as a weighted sum
/// of the input features plus a constant term (intercept) if included.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Multivariate regression is like a recipe that combines several ingredients to predict an outcome.
/// 
/// Think of it like a car's fuel efficiency calculator:
/// - You provide information like car weight, engine size, aerodynamics, etc.
/// - Each factor has a certain importance (coefficient) in determining fuel efficiency
/// - The model combines all these factors to make a prediction
/// 
/// For example, the formula might be:
/// Miles per gallon = 35 - (0.005 × Car Weight) - (2 × Engine Size) + (3 × Aerodynamic Rating)
/// 
/// The model learns the best values for these coefficients from your training data to make accurate predictions.

    /// This method trains the multivariate regression model using the normal equation approach, which finds the optimal
    /// coefficients by solving a system of linear equations. The normal equation is given by:
    /// coefficients = (X^T * X + regularization)^(-1) * X^T * y, where X^T is the transpose of the feature matrix X.
    /// This approach directly computes the optimal coefficients without requiring iterative optimization.
    /// </para>
    /// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This is where the model learns from your data.
    /// 
    /// During training:
    /// 1. If an intercept is used, an extra column of 1's is added to the input features
    /// 2. The model applies mathematical operations to find the best coefficients
    /// 3. These coefficients determine how much each feature contributes to the prediction
    /// 
    /// Unlike some other models that learn gradually through many iterations, multivariate regression
    /// finds the optimal solution in one step by solving a mathematical equation.
    /// 
    /// For example, the model might learn that for car fuel efficiency:
    /// - Each additional pound of weight reduces efficiency by 0.005 mpg
    /// - Each liter of engine size reduces efficiency by 2 mpg
    /// - Each point in aerodynamic rating improves efficiency by 3 mpg
