/// Implements a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) for regression, which models the target as a sum of smooth functions

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Generalized Additive Models extend linear regression by allowing nonlinear relationships between features and the target
/// variable, while maintaining additivity. Each feature is transformed using basis functions (typically splines), and
/// the model is expressed as a sum of these transformations. This approach balances flexibility and interpretability,
/// as the effect of each feature can be visualized independently.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Generalized Additive Model is like a more flexible version of linear regression.
/// 
/// Instead of assuming that each feature has a straight-line relationship with the target (like y = mx + b),
/// GAMs allow each feature to have its own curved relationship with the target. The model then adds up
/// all these individual curves to make a prediction.
/// 
/// Think of it this way:
/// - Linear regression: House price = a × Size + b × Age + c × Location + ...
/// - GAM: House price = f1(Size) + f2(Age) + f3(Location) + ...
///   Where f1, f2, f3 are curves rather than straight lines
/// 
/// The benefit is that you can:
/// - Capture more complex patterns in your data
/// - Still understand how each feature individually affects the prediction
/// - Visualize the shape of the relationship for each feature
/// 
/// GAMs are a good middle ground between simple linear models and complex "black box" models
/// like neural networks.
