/// AdaBoost.R2 (Adaptive Boosting for Regression) is an extension of the AdaBoost algorithm for regression tasks.
/// It works by training a sequence of weak regressors (decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data.
/// The predictions from all regressors are then combined through a weighted majority vote to produce the final prediction.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// In AdaBoost.R2, each training sample is assigned a weight that determines its importance during training.
/// Initially, all weights are equal. For each iteration, the weights of incorrectly predicted samples are increased
/// so that subsequent weak regressors focus more on difficult cases. The algorithm stops when the specified number
/// of estimators is reached or when the error rate exceeds 0.5.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> AdaBoost.R2 is a powerful machine learning technique for predicting numeric values
/// (like prices, temperatures, or ages) rather than categories.
/// 
/// Think of AdaBoost.R2 as a team of experts (decision trees) working together to make predictions:
/// 1. The first "expert" makes predictions on all the training data
/// 2. The algorithm identifies which samples were predicted poorly
/// 3. The next expert pays special attention to those difficult samples
/// 4. This process repeats, creating a team of experts that each specialize in different aspects of the problem
/// 5. When making predictions, all experts "vote" on the final answer, but experts who performed better get more voting power
/// 
/// This approach is particularly effective because:
/// - It can turn a collection of "weak" learners (simple decision trees) into a "strong" learner
/// - It automatically focuses on the hardest parts of the problem
/// - It's less prone to overfitting than a single, complex model
/// 
/// AdaBoost.R2 is ideal for problems where you need high prediction accuracy and have enough training data
/// to build multiple models.
