/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Gradient Boosting is an ensemble technique that builds decision trees sequentially, with each tree
/// correcting the errors made by the previous trees. The model starts with a simple prediction (typically
/// the mean of the target values) and iteratively adds trees that predict the residuals (errors) of the
/// current ensemble. These predictions are added to the ensemble with a learning rate that controls the
/// contribution of each tree, helping to prevent overfitting.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Gradient Boosting is like having a team of experts who learn from each other's mistakes.
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to predict house prices:
/// - You start with a simple guess (the average price of all houses)
/// - You build a decision tree to predict where your guess was wrong
/// - You adjust your prediction a little bit based on this tree
/// - You build another tree to predict where you're still making mistakes
/// - You keep adding trees, each one focusing on fixing the remaining errors
/// 
/// The "gradient" part refers to how it identifies mistakes, and "boosting" means it builds trees 
/// sequentially, with each tree boosting the performance of the ensemble.
/// 
/// This approach is very powerful because:
/// - It learns complex patterns gradually
/// - It focuses its effort on the hard-to-predict cases
/// - It combines many simple models (trees) into a strong predictive model
