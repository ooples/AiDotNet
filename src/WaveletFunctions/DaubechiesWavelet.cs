/// Daubechies wavelets are like special mathematical magnifying glasses that can analyze
/// signals at different levels of detail. They're named after Ingrid Daubechies, a mathematician
/// who made groundbreaking contributions to wavelet theory.
/// 
/// Key features of Daubechies wavelets:
/// - They have compact support (affect only a limited region)
/// - They can have a specified number of vanishing moments
/// - They're orthogonal (no redundancy in the transform)
/// - They're asymmetric (unlike some other wavelets)
/// 
/// "Vanishing moments" means the wavelet can ignore certain polynomial trends in the data.
/// For example, a wavelet with 2 vanishing moments will be "blind" to constant and linear trends,
/// allowing it to focus on more complex patterns.
/// 
/// These wavelets are particularly useful for:
/// - Image compression (JPEG2000 uses them)
/// - Signal denoising
/// - Feature extraction
/// - Data compression
/// 
/// The order parameter (typically denoted as D2, D4, D6, etc., where the number is twice the order)
/// controls how many vanishing moments the wavelet has, with higher orders providing more
/// vanishing moments but wider support.
