/// The Complex Morlet wavelet is one of the most widely used wavelets for time-frequency analysis.

/// The Complex Morlet wavelet is like a mathematical magnifying glass that can see both
/// the "what" (frequency) and "when" (time) of patterns in your data simultaneously.
/// 
/// Key features of Complex Morlet wavelets:
/// - They combine a sine wave with a bell-shaped curve (Gaussian)
/// - They can detect oscillations in signals with great precision
/// - They work with complex numbers to capture both amplitude and phase
/// - They're excellent for analyzing rhythmic or oscillatory patterns
/// 
/// Think of them as special detectors that can find specific "musical notes" in your data
/// and tell you exactly when they occur.
/// 
/// These wavelets are particularly useful for:
/// - Audio processing and music analysis
/// - Brain wave (EEG) analysis
/// - Vibration analysis in mechanical systems
/// - Financial time series analysis
/// - Any application where finding oscillatory patterns is important
/// 
/// The parameters omega and sigma let you tune the wavelet to look for specific frequencies
/// and control how precise it is in time versus frequency.
