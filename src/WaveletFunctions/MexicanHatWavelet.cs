/// <para>
/// The Mexican Hat wavelet, also known as the Ricker wavelet or the second derivative of the Gaussian function,
/// is a wavelet consisting of a negative normalized second derivative of a Gaussian function.
/// It is commonly used in image processing, computer vision, and various signal analysis applications
/// due to its ability to detect transitions and edges at multiple scales.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The Mexican Hat wavelet looks like a sombrero or a bell curve with a dip in the middle.
/// 
/// Think of the Mexican Hat wavelet like a special pattern-matching tool that:
/// - Has a distinctive shape with a central peak surrounded by two valleys, then tapering to zero
/// - Is excellent at detecting edges, boundaries, and "blob-like" features in your data
/// - Gets its name because its shape resembles a Mexican sombrero hat viewed from above
/// 
/// This wavelet is particularly useful for finding places where your data changes its direction
/// twice in a row (like going up, then down, then up again). This makes it ideal for detecting
/// objects in images, finding peaks in signals, or identifying boundaries between different regions.
