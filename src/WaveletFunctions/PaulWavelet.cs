/// <para>
/// The Paul wavelet is a complex-valued wavelet that belongs to the family of analytic wavelets.
/// It is particularly useful for analyzing oscillatory behaviors and phase information in signals.
/// The Paul wavelet is defined in terms of complex functions and provides good time resolution
/// with moderate frequency resolution, making it suitable for extracting instantaneous phases
/// and detecting transient phenomena in signals.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The Paul wavelet is a special mathematical tool for analyzing phases and oscillations in data.

/// Think of the Paul wavelet like a specialized detector that:
/// - Can identify not just when oscillations occur, but also their phase (position in the cycle)
/// - Is particularly good at finding short-lived patterns in your data
/// - Works with complex numbers (numbers with both real and imaginary parts)
/// 
/// This wavelet is especially useful when you need to track how phases change over time,
/// such as in brain wave analysis, fluid dynamics, or geophysical signal processing.
/// Unlike some other wavelets, the Paul wavelet is asymmetric, which makes it particularly
/// sensitive to the direction of changes in your data.
