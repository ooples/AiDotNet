/// The Mexican Hat wavelet is the negative normalized second derivative of a Gaussian function.

/// The Mexican Hat wavelet looks like a sombrero or a mountain with valleys on each side.
/// This shape makes it excellent at finding "bumps" or peaks in your data.
/// 
/// Key features of the Mexican Hat wavelet:
/// - It has a central positive peak with negative valleys on either side
/// - It's symmetric (the same on both sides of the center)
/// - It's good at detecting sudden changes or peaks in signals
/// - It has no scaling function in the traditional sense
/// 
/// Think of it as a template that you slide over your data, looking for places where
/// the data has a similar "bump" shape. When the wavelet aligns with a bump in your data,
/// it produces a strong response.
/// 
/// These wavelets are particularly useful for:
/// - Finding peaks in spectra
/// - Edge detection in images
/// - Scale-space analysis
/// - Feature detection in various signals
/// - Analyzing data where you need to identify local maxima or minima
/// 
/// Unlike some other wavelets, the Mexican Hat is primarily used for continuous wavelet
/// transforms rather than discrete transforms, though this implementation provides
/// both capabilities.
