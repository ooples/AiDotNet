/// Key features of DOG wavelets:
/// - They're based on derivatives of the Gaussian function (bell curve)

/// - They're symmetric (the same on both sides of the center)
/// - They have good localization in both time and frequency
/// 
/// Think of them as detectors that respond strongly when your data shows specific
/// patterns of change:
/// - 1st order (order=1): Detects edges (sudden jumps)
/// - 2nd order (order=2): Detects peaks and valleys (Mexican Hat wavelet)
/// - Higher orders: Detect more complex patterns of change
/// 
/// These wavelets are particularly useful for:
/// - Edge detection in signals and images
/// - Finding points where data changes rapidly
