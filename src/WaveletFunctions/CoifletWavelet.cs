/// Coiflet wavelets are special mathematical tools designed to analyze signals with particular properties.
/// 
/// Key features of Coiflet wavelets:
/// - They're nearly symmetric (more symmetric than Daubechies wavelets)
/// - They have vanishing moments for both the wavelet and scaling functions
/// - They have compact support (affect only a limited region)
/// 
/// "Vanishing moments" means the wavelet can ignore certain polynomial trends in the data.
/// For example, a wavelet with 3 vanishing moments will be "blind" to constant, linear, and
/// quadratic trends, allowing it to focus on more complex patterns.
/// 
/// These properties make Coiflet wavelets particularly useful for:
/// - Signal compression
/// - Feature extraction
/// - Numerical analysis
/// - Applications where symmetry is important
/// 
/// The order parameter (1-5) controls how many vanishing moments the wavelet has,
/// with higher orders providing more vanishing moments but wider support.
