/// <para>
/// The Morlet wavelet is a complex wavelet defined as a plane wave modulated by a Gaussian window.
/// It offers excellent time-frequency localization and is widely used in signal processing, geophysics,
/// audio analysis, and various other fields. This implementation supports customization of the central
/// frequency parameter, which affects the balance between time and frequency resolution.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The Morlet wavelet is like a tunable detector for patterns in your data.

/// Think of the Morlet wavelet like a musical note with an adjustable pitch that:
/// - Has a smooth bell-shaped envelope (like a Gaussian curve)
/// - Contains oscillations (like a cosine wave) inside this envelope
/// - Can be tuned to detect specific frequencies in your data
/// 
/// This wavelet is particularly good at analyzing signals where you need to know
/// both when something happens (time localization) and what frequencies are present
/// (frequency localization). It's commonly used for analyzing audio, brain waves (EEG),
/// vibrations, and many other types of signals.
