/// <para>
/// Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) is an extension of standard gradient descent that handles regularization more
/// efficiently. The algorithm alternates between performing a gradient descent step to minimize the loss function
/// and applying a proximal operator to enforce regularization. This approach is particularly effective for
/// problems where regularization is important to prevent overfitting or to enforce specific properties in the solution.

/// - Proximal gradient descent adds boundaries or "guardrails" to your path
/// - These guardrails keep you from wandering into areas that might look good but are actually not helpful
/// - For example, the guardrails might prevent solutions that are too complex and would overfit the data
