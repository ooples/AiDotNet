/// Simulated Annealing is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy,
/// where materials are heated and then slowly cooled to reduce defects. The algorithm starts with a high "temperature"
/// that allows it to accept worse solutions with a certain probability, helping it escape local optima. As the
/// temperature gradually decreases, the algorithm becomes more selective, eventually converging to a good solution.

/// Imagine a hiker exploring a mountain range in fog, trying to find the lowest point:
/// - When it's hot (high temperature), the hiker is willing to climb uphill sometimes
/// - This helps avoid getting stuck in small valleys that aren't the true lowest point
/// - As it gets cooler (temperature decreases), the hiker becomes less willing to go uphill
/// - Eventually, when it's cold, the hiker only moves downhill to find the precise low point
