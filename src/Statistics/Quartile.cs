/// The Quartile class calculates the three standard quartiles of a dataset: the first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile),
/// the second quartile (Q2, 50th percentile or median), and the third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile).
/// These quartiles divide the dataset into four equal parts and provide insights into the distribution of the data.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Quartiles divide your data into four equal parts, giving you a quick way to understand
/// the distribution of your values.
/// 
/// Think of quartiles like dividing a line of people by height into four equal groups:
/// - Q1 (First Quartile): The height where 25% of people are shorter and 75% are taller
/// - Q2 (Second Quartile): The height where 50% are shorter and 50% are taller (this is also called the median)
/// - Q3 (Third Quartile): The height where 75% are shorter and 25% are taller
/// 
/// Quartiles help you understand:
/// - Where the "middle half" of your data lies (between Q1 and Q3)
/// - If your data is skewed (if the distance from Q1 to Q2 is different from Q2 to Q3)
/// - What values might be considered outliers (typically those below Q1-1.5×IQR or above Q3+1.5×IQR)
/// 
/// For example, if test scores have Q1=70, Q2=80, and Q3=90, you know half the scores are between 70 and 90,
/// and the median score is 80.
