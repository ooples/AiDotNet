    /// For Beginners:
    /// This method allows you to check if a particular metric is available before trying to get its value.
    /// It's useful when you're not sure if a specific metric was calculated for this set of errors.
    /// 
    /// For example:
    /// <code>
    /// if (stats.HasMetric(MetricType.MAE))
    /// {
    ///     var maeValue = stats.GetMetric(MetricType.MAE);
    ///     // Use maeValue...
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// 
    /// This prevents errors that might occur if you try to access a metric that wasn't calculated.
