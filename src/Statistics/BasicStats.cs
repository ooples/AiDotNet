/// their important patterns and characteristics.
/// 
/// It answers questions like:
/// - What's the typical value? (Mean, Median)
/// - How spread out are the values? (Variance, StandardDeviation)
/// - What's the range of values? (Min, Max, InterquartileRange)
/// - Is the distribution skewed or symmetric? (Skewness)
/// - Are there unusual extreme values? (Kurtosis)
/// 
/// For example, if you have test scores from a class:
/// - Mean tells you the average score
/// - StandardDeviation tells you how much scores vary from that average
/// - Skewness might reveal if more students scored above or below average
