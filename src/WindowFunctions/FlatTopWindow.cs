/// Implements the Flat Top window function for signal processing applications.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Flat Top window is a specialized window function designed for amplitude accuracy in spectral analysis.
/// It uses a weighted sum of cosine terms:
/// w(n) = 1.0 - 1.93 * cos(2pn/(N-1)) + 1.29 * cos(4pn/(N-1)) - 0.388 * cos(6pn/(N-1)) + 0.028 * cos(8pn/(N-1))
/// where n is the sample index and N is the window size.
/// The Flat Top window has superior amplitude accuracy but poorer frequency resolution compared to other windows.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is a mathematical tool that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Flat Top window:
/// - Has a unique shape with a flat middle section and steep sides
/// - Is specifically designed for accurate measurement of signal amplitudes
/// - Sacrifices frequency precision for amplitude precision
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to measure the height of people in a crowd. Some window functions might 
/// give you a good idea of how many people are of each height (frequency resolution), but the 
/// Flat Top window specializes in telling you exactly how tall each person is (amplitude accuracy). 
/// This makes it ideal for calibration, testing, and situations where you need to know the exact 
/// strength of a signal component rather than just detecting its presence.
