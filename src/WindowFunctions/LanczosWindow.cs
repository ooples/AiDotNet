/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Lanczos window is based on the Lanczos kernel (sinc function) and is defined by the equation:
/// w(n) = sinc(2n/(N-1) - 1)
/// where n is the sample index, N is the window size, and sinc(x) = sin(px)/(px) for x ? 0 and sinc(0) = 1.
/// The Lanczos window provides good frequency resolution while reducing side lobe amplitude.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Lanczos window:
/// - Creates a smooth curve based on the sinc function (sin(x)/x)
/// - Provides good preservation of the main signal features
/// - Is particularly useful for resampling and interpolation tasks
/// 
/// Think of the Lanczos window like a special camera filter that helps capture more detail without 
/// distortion. The sinc function it's based on is fundamental in signal processing because it has 
/// ideal frequency characteristics - it can perfectly reconstruct bandwidth-limited signals. In practice, 
/// the Lanczos window is commonly used when resizing images, resampling audio, or analyzing data 
/// where preserving the main features of the signal is important.
