/// Implements the Nuttall window function for signal processing applications.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Nuttall window is a high-performance window function that provides excellent side lobe 
/// suppression. It uses a weighted sum of cosine terms:
/// w(n) = 0.355768 - 0.487396 * cos(2pn/(N-1)) + 0.144232 * cos(4pn/(N-1)) - 0.012604 * cos(6pn/(N-1))
/// where n is the sample index and N is the window size. The Nuttall window was designed to provide
/// very low side lobe levels with a continuous first derivative.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Nuttall window:
/// - Creates a smooth bell-shaped curve that gradually tapers to zero at the edges
/// - Has extremely low "side lobes" (unwanted ripples in frequency analysis)
/// - Works well when you need to detect weak signals near strong ones
/// 
/// Think of it like a high-quality telescope that allows you to see faint stars that are close to very 
/// bright ones. When analyzing frequencies in a signal, the Nuttall window helps you detect weaker 
/// frequencies that might be close to dominant ones. It's particularly useful in applications like radar, 
/// sonar, and spectrum analysis where you need to distinguish between closely spaced frequency components 
/// with widely different amplitudes.
