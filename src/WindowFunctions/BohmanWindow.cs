/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Bohman window is a specialized window function that provides excellent spectral characteristics
/// with very low sidelobe levels. It's defined by a more complex formula compared to simpler windows:
/// w(n) = (1 - |x|) * cos(p|x|) + (1/p) * sin(p|x|)
/// where x = 2n/(N-1) - 1 and n is the sample index and N is the window size.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Bohman window:
/// - Creates a smooth bell-shaped curve that touches zero at both ends
/// - Has excellent performance in reducing "spectral leakage" (unwanted frequency artifacts)
/// - Uses a more complex mathematical formula than simpler windows
/// 
/// Think of signal processing like trying to hear one conversation in a crowded room. 
/// The Bohman window is like a sophisticated noise-canceling headphone that helps you 
/// focus on just the conversation you want to hear, filtering out background noise very 
/// effectively. It's particularly useful in applications where you need to distinguish 
/// between frequencies that are very close to each other, such as radar systems, sonar, 
/// or detailed audio analysis.
