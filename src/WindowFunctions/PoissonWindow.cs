/// The Poisson window is an exponential window function defined by the equation:
/// w(n) = exp(-a|n-N/2|/(N/2))
/// where n is the sample index, N is the window size, and a (alpha) is a parameter
/// that controls the rate of decay from the center of the window to the edges.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Poisson window:
/// - Creates a curve that decays exponentially from the center to the edges
/// - Has a shape that can be adjusted using the alpha parameter
/// - Provides a smooth transition that helps reduce artifacts in frequency analysis
/// 
/// Think of the Poisson window like a spotlight that gradually fades out from the center.
/// The alpha parameter controls how quickly this fading happens - a higher alpha means
/// a faster fade out from the center. This gradual fading helps when analyzing signals by
/// reducing the artificial effects that occur when you're only looking at a segment of
/// a longer signal.
