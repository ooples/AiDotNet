/// Implements the Gaussian window function for signal processing applications.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Gaussian window is based on the Gaussian (normal) distribution and provides excellent 
/// time-frequency localization. It is defined by the equation:
/// w(n) = exp(-(n-N/2)²/(2s²))
/// where n is the sample index, N is the window size, and s (sigma) controls the width of the window.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Gaussian window:
/// - Creates a smooth bell-shaped curve (like the famous "bell curve" in statistics)
/// - Has a shape that can be adjusted using the sigma parameter
/// - Provides a good balance between time and frequency resolution
/// 
/// Think of it like a spotlight with adjustable focus. A narrow spotlight (small sigma) gives you 
/// very precise location information but less overall visibility. A wide spotlight (large sigma) 
/// shows you more of the scene but with less precision about exact locations. The Gaussian window 
/// works the same way when analyzing frequencies in signals - you can adjust it to balance between 
/// precise frequency measurement and detecting the presence of multiple frequencies.
