/// Implements the Cosine window function (sometimes called Sine window) for signal processing applications.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Cosine window function is a simple yet effective window defined by the sine function:
/// w(n) = sin(pn/(N-1))
/// where n is the sample index and N is the window size.
/// Despite its name, this window actually uses the sine function mathematically, but it's called
/// the Cosine window due to historical convention in signal processing.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is a mathematical tool that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Cosine window:
/// - Creates a smooth half-sine wave shape from 0 to 1 and back to 0
/// - Has a simple mathematical form compared to other windows
/// - Provides a gentle tapering effect at the edges of your data
/// 
/// Think of it like gradually turning the volume up and then down when listening to audio.
/// Instead of an abrupt start and stop (which can cause distortion in analysis), the Cosine 
/// window smoothly increases from zero, reaches its maximum in the middle, and then smoothly 
/// decreases back to zero at the end. This helps reduce unwanted artifacts when analyzing 
/// frequencies in your data.
