/// <para>
/// The Blackman window is a commonly used window function that provides good frequency resolution 
/// and reduced spectral leakage. It uses a weighted cosine series with three terms:
/// w(n) = 0.42 - 0.5 * cos(2pn/(N-1)) + 0.08 * cos(4pn/(N-1))
/// where n is the sample index and N is the window size.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is a mathematical tool that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Blackman window:
/// - Creates a smooth bell-shaped curve that's zero at both ends
/// - Provides a good balance between time and frequency resolution
/// - Reduces unwanted "spectral leakage" (false frequency readings)
/// 
/// Think of it like a magnifying glass with special properties - when you look at a signal through 
/// this "Blackman lens," you can more clearly see its true frequency components without as much 
/// distortion. It's commonly used in audio processing, vibration analysis, and other signal 
/// processing applications.
