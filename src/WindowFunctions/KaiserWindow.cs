/// Implements the Kaiser window function for signal processing applications.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Kaiser window is a flexible window function based on the modified Bessel function of the first kind.
/// It is defined by the equation:
/// w(n) = I0(ßv(1-(2n/(N-1))²))/I0(ß)
/// where n is the sample index, N is the window size, I0 is the modified Bessel function of the first kind
/// of order zero, and ß (beta) is a parameter that controls the trade-off between the main lobe width
/// and side lobe amplitude.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Kaiser window:
/// - Creates a bell-shaped curve that can be adjusted using the beta parameter
/// - Allows you to control the trade-off between frequency resolution and spectral leakage
/// - Is highly versatile for different signal processing needs
/// 
/// Think of the Kaiser window like adjustable eyeglasses. The beta parameter works like a focus control:
/// - With a low beta (e.g., 1-2), it's like wide-angle glasses that let you see more frequencies
///   but with less precision about their exact strength
/// - With a high beta (e.g., 8-10), it's like zoom glasses that show you precise frequency information
///   but might miss nearby frequencies
/// 
/// This adjustability makes the Kaiser window useful in many applications from audio processing
/// to telecommunications to radar systems.
