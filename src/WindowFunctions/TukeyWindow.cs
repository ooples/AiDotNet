/// Implements the Tukey window function (also known as tapered cosine window) for signal processing applications.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Tukey window is a flexible window function that combines a flat top (Rectangular window)
/// with cosine tapered edges. It is defined by a piecewise function controlled by the alpha parameter:
/// 
/// For 0 = n = aN/2:
///   w(n) = 0.5 * (1 + cos(p * (2n/aN - 1)))
/// For aN/2 &lt; n &lt; N - aN/2:
///   w(n) = 1
/// For N - aN/2 = n = N:
///   w(n) = 0.5 * (1 + cos(p * (2n/aN - 2/a + 1)))
/// 
/// where n is the sample index, N is (windowSize - 1), and a (alpha) is a parameter between 0 and 1
/// that controls the width of the cosine tapered regions.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Tukey window:
/// - Combines the best features of Rectangular and Cosine windows
/// - Has a flat middle section and smoothly tapered edges
/// - Can be adjusted using the alpha parameter to control how much tapering occurs
/// 
/// Think of it like a plateau with gentle slopes on both sides. The alpha parameter controls
/// how much of the window is plateau versus slope:
/// - An alpha of 0 creates a completely flat plateau (identical to a Rectangular window)
/// - An alpha of 1 creates a window with no plateau, just slopes (identical to a Hann window)
/// - Values in between (like the default 0.5) create a mix of plateau and slopes
/// 
/// This flexibility makes the Tukey window useful in many applications where you need
/// to balance preserving signal strength with reducing spectral leakage.
