/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Hanning window is a popular window function that provides good frequency resolution and 
/// reduced spectral leakage. It is defined by the equation:
/// w(n) = 0.5 * (1 - cos(2pn/(N-1)))
/// where n is the sample index and N is the window size. The Hanning window reaches exactly zero 
/// at both ends, which makes it particularly useful for analyzing periodic signals.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Hanning window:
/// - Creates a smooth bell-shaped curve that starts and ends exactly at zero
/// - Has a simple mathematical form that makes it easy to implement
/// - Provides a good balance between frequency resolution and spectral leakage
/// 
/// Think of it like looking through a window with edges that gradually fade to black. When analyzing 
/// frequencies in a signal (like audio), the Hanning window helps reduce the artifacts that occur 
/// when you're only looking at a portion of a continuous signal. It's particularly good for analyzing 
/// sounds like musical notes or any other signals that repeat over time.
