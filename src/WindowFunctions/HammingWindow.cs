/// Implements the Hamming window function for signal processing applications.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Hamming window is a widely used window function that provides good frequency resolution
/// and reduced spectral leakage. It is defined by the equation:
/// w(n) = 0.54 - 0.46 * cos(2pn/(N-1))
/// where n is the sample index and N is the window size. The Hamming window is optimized to
/// minimize the maximum sidelobe amplitude, making it particularly useful for spectral analysis.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Hamming window:
/// - Creates a bell-shaped curve that tapers to near-zero (but not exactly zero) at the edges
/// - Is specifically designed to reduce "spectral leakage" (unwanted frequency artifacts)
/// - Offers a good balance of spectral resolution and amplitude accuracy
/// 
/// Think of it like a pair of well-designed sunglasses that reduces glare while still providing
/// a clear view. When analyzing frequencies in a signal (like audio), the Hamming window helps
/// you see the true frequencies more clearly by reducing unwanted artifacts. It's named after
/// Richard Hamming, who developed it for telecommunications applications, and is one of the most
/// commonly used window functions because of its good all-around performance.
