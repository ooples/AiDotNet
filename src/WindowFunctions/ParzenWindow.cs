/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Parzen window is a piecewise cubic approximation of the Gaussian window. It is defined by a piecewise function:
/// For |n - N/2| = N/4:
///   w(n) = 1 - 6(2|n-N/2|/N)² + 6(2|n-N/2|/N)³
/// For N/4 &lt; |n - N/2| = N/2:
///   w(n) = 2(1 - 2|n-N/2|/N)³
/// where n is the sample index and N is the window size.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Parzen window:
/// - Creates a smooth curve that looks similar to a bell curve (Gaussian shape)
/// - Has excellent side lobe suppression (reduces unwanted frequency artifacts)
/// - Uses different mathematical formulas for different parts of the window
/// 
/// Think of the Parzen window like a carefully designed dimmer switch that doesn't just
/// turn the lights up and down, but does so in a mathematically precise way. The central
/// part of the window follows one formula, while the outer parts follow another. This
/// special design helps improve frequency analysis by reducing measurement errors that
/// occur when analyzing a limited segment of a continuous signal.
