/// <para>
/// A Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) is an advanced neural network architecture that augments neural networks with
/// an external memory matrix and mechanisms to read from and write to this memory. DNCs can learn to use their memory
/// to store and retrieve information, enabling them to solve complex, structured problems that require reasoning and
/// algorithm-like behavior. The key components include a controller neural network, a memory matrix, and read/write heads
/// that interact with the memory through differentiable attention mechanisms.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Differentiable Neural Computer is like a neural network with a notepad.
/// 
/// Imagine a traditional neural network as a person who can make decisions based on what they see,
/// but can only keep information in their head. A DNC is like giving that person a notepad to:
/// - Write down important information
/// - Organize notes in a systematic way
/// - Look back at previously written notes when making decisions
/// - Learn which information is worth writing down and when to refer back to it
/// 
/// This combination of neural processing with external memory allows the DNC to solve problems that
/// require remembering and reasoning about complex relationships or sequences of information, like
/// navigating a subway map or following a multi-step recipe.
