/// A Liquid State Machine is a form of reservoir computing that uses a recurrent neural network with 
/// randomly connected neurons (the "reservoir") to process temporal information. The reservoir transforms

/// - By observing these ripple patterns, you can determine what objects were dropped in

/// In a Liquid State Machine:
/// - The "reservoir" is like the pool of water with randomly connected neurons
/// - Input signals create "ripples" of activity through the connected neurons
/// - The network learns to recognize patterns in how these ripples develop over time
