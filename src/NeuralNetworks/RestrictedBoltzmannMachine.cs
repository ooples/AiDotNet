/// A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a two-layer neural network that learns to reconstruct its input data.
/// Unlike feedforward networks, RBMs are generative models that learn the probability distribution of the training data.
/// They consist of a visible layer (representing the input data) and a hidden layer (representing features), with
/// connections between layers but no connections within a layer (hence "restricted"). RBMs are trained using an
/// algorithm called Contrastive Divergence, which involves both forward and backward passes between layers.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Restricted Boltzmann Machine is like a two-way translator between data and features.
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// - The visible layer is like words in English
/// - The hidden layer is like words in French
/// - The network learns how to translate back and forth between the languages
/// 
/// When you train an RBM:
/// - It learns to recognize patterns in your data (translate English to French)
/// - It also learns to recreate the original data from those patterns (translate French back to English)
/// 
/// For example, if you train an RBM on images of faces:
/// - The visible layer represents the pixel values of the images
/// - The hidden layer might learn to recognize features like "has a mustache" or "is smiling"
/// - Once trained, you could activate certain hidden units to generate new face images with specific features
/// 
/// RBMs can be used for dimensionality reduction, feature learning, pattern completion, and even generating
/// new data samples similar to the training data.
