/// <para>
/// A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a powerful machine learning architecture that uses two neural networks - 
/// a generator and a discriminator - that are trained simultaneously through adversarial training. The generator 
/// network learns to create realistic synthetic data samples (like images), while the discriminator network learns 
/// to distinguish between real data and the generator's synthetic outputs. As training progresses, the generator 
/// becomes better at creating realistic data, and the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing real from fake, 
/// pushing each other to improve in a competitive process.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A GAN is like an art forger and an art detective competing against each other.
/// 
/// Think of it this way:
/// - The generator is like an art forger trying to create fake paintings that look real
/// - The discriminator is like an art detective trying to tell which paintings are real and which are fake
/// - As the forger gets better, the detective has to improve too
/// - As the detective gets better, the forger is forced to create more convincing fakes
/// - Eventually, the forger becomes so good that their fake paintings are nearly indistinguishable from real ones
/// 
/// This continuous competition drives both networks to improve, resulting in a generator that
/// can create remarkably realistic synthetic data like images, music, or text.
