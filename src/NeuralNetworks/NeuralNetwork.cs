/// Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain. They consist of multiple layers
/// of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input data to produce predictions. This class provides
/// a straightforward implementation that can be used for various machine learning tasks.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A neural network is like a brain-inspired system that learns from examples.
/// 
/// Think of a neural network as an assembly line for information:
/// - Input data enters the "factory" (like features of an image or text)
/// - It passes through several processing stations (layers of neurons)
/// - Each station transforms the information in specific ways
/// - Finally, it produces an output (like a prediction or classification)
/// 
/// For example, if you want to classify images of cats and dogs:
/// - The input would be the pixel values of the image
/// - The neural network processes these values through its layers
/// - Each layer learns to recognize different patterns (edges, shapes, textures, etc.)
/// - The output tells you the probability of the image containing a cat or dog
/// 
/// The network "learns" by adjusting its internal parameters based on examples,
/// gradually improving its predictions through a process called training.
