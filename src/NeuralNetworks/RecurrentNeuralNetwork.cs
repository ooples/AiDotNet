/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a class of neural networks that can process sequential data by maintaining
/// an internal state (memory) that captures information about previous inputs. Unlike traditional feedforward
/// neural networks, RNNs have connections that form directed cycles, allowing information to persist from one step
/// to the next. This architectural feature makes RNNs particularly well-suited for tasks involving sequential data,
/// such as time series prediction, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Recurrent Neural Network is a type of neural network that has memory.
/// 
/// Think of it like reading a book:
/// - A standard neural network looks at each word in isolation
/// - An RNN remembers what it read earlier to understand the current word
/// 
/// For example, in the sentence "The clouds were dark, so I took my umbrella," an RNN understands that
/// "I took my umbrella" is related to "The clouds were dark" because it remembers the earlier part of the sentence.
/// 
/// This memory makes RNNs good at:
/// - Processing sequences like sentences, time series, or music
/// - Understanding context and relationships over time
/// - Predicting what comes next in a sequence
/// 
/// Common applications include text generation, translation, speech recognition, and stock price prediction - 
/// all tasks where what happened before affects how you interpret what's happening now.
