/// Represents a neural network that utilizes attention mechanisms for sequence processing.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// An attention network is a specialized neural network architecture designed for sequence processing tasks.
/// It uses attention mechanisms to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating
/// outputs. This allows the network to capture long-range dependencies and relationships between elements in 
/// the sequence, making it particularly effective for tasks like natural language processing, time series analysis,
/// and other sequence-to-sequence problems.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This network mimics how humans pay attention to different parts of information.
/// 
/// Think of it like reading a complex paragraph:
/// - When you try to understand a sentence, you don't focus equally on all words
/// - You focus more on the important words that carry meaning
/// - You also connect related words even if they're far apart
/// 
/// For example, in the sentence "The cat, which had a white spot on its tail, chased the mouse":
/// - An attention network would connect "cat" with "chased" even though they're separated
/// - It would assign different importance to different words based on context
/// - This helps it understand the overall meaning better than networks that process words in isolation
/// 
/// This ability to selectively focus and connect distant information makes attention networks
/// powerful for language tasks, time series prediction, and many other sequence-based problems.
