/// Represents a Capsule Network, a type of neural network that preserves spatial relationships between features.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// A Capsule Network is a neural network architecture designed to address limitations of traditional convolutional
/// neural networks. Instead of using scalar-output feature detectors (neurons), Capsule Networks use vector-output
/// capsules. Each capsule's output vector represents the presence of an entity and its instantiation parameters
/// (like position, orientation, and scale). This architecture helps to preserve hierarchical relationships
/// between features, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring understanding of spatial relationships.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Capsule Network is like a more advanced version of traditional neural networks.
/// 
/// Think of it this way:
/// - Traditional networks detect features like edges or textures, but lose information about how these features relate to each other
/// - Capsule Networks not only detect features, but also understand their relationships, orientations, and positions
/// - This is like the difference between recognizing individual puzzle pieces versus understanding how they fit together
/// 
/// For example, a traditional network might recognize an eye, a nose, and a mouth separately, but a Capsule Network
/// can better understand that these features need to be in a specific arrangement to make a face. This makes
/// Capsule Networks particularly good at recognizing objects from different angles or when parts are arranged differently.
/// </para>
