/// <para>
/// A Variational Autoencoder is a type of generative model that learns to encode input data into a 
/// probabilistic latent space and then decode samples from that space back into the original data space.
/// Unlike standard autoencoders, VAEs ensure the latent space has good properties for generating new samples 
/// by learning a distribution rather than a fixed encoding.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// VAEs consist of:
/// - An encoder network that maps input data to a probability distribution in latent space
/// - A sampling mechanism that draws samples from this distribution
/// - A decoder network that maps samples from latent space back to the original data space
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Variational Autoencoder is like a creative compression system.
/// 
/// Imagine you have a folder full of photos of cats:
/// - The encoder is like a person who studies all these photos and learns to describe any cat using just a few key attributes (like fur color, ear shape, size)
/// - These few attributes are the "latent space" - a much smaller representation of the data
/// - The special thing about a VAE is that instead of exact values, it describes each attribute as a range of possible values (a probability distribution)
/// - The decoder is like an artist who can take these attribute descriptions and draw a new cat based on them
/// 
/// This ability to work with probability distributions means:
/// - You can generate new, never-before-seen cats by sampling from these distributions
/// - The generated cats will look realistic because they follow the patterns learned from real cats
/// - You can smoothly transition between different types of cats by moving through the latent space
/// 
/// VAEs are used for image generation, data compression, anomaly detection, and other creative applications.
