/// <para>
/// A Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) is a specialized type of neural network that uses radial basis functions as
/// activation functions. Unlike traditional neural networks, RBFNs typically have only one hidden layer with a non-linear
/// radial basis function, followed by a linear output layer. This architecture makes them particularly effective for
/// function approximation, classification, and systems control problems.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Radial Basis Function Network is a special type of neural network designed to learn patterns differently than standard networks.
/// 
/// Think of it like a weather prediction system:
/// - Traditional neural networks might look at many factors and gradually learn weather patterns
/// - An RBFN instead has "weather experts" (the radial basis functions) who each specialize in a specific weather pattern
/// - When new data comes in, each expert reports how similar the current conditions are to their specialty
/// - The network combines these similarity reports to make a prediction
/// 
/// For example, one expert might specialize in "sunny summer days," another in "rainy spring mornings," and so on.
/// When given new weather data, they each report how close it matches their expertise, and the network uses these
/// reports to predict the weather.
/// 
/// RBFNs are particularly good at:
/// - Learning complex patterns quickly
/// - Function approximation (finding the shape of unknown mathematical functions)
/// - Classification problems (determining which category something belongs to)
