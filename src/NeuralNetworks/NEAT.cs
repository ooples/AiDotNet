/// <para>
/// NEAT is an evolutionary algorithm that creates and evolves neural network topologies along with connection weights.
/// Unlike traditional neural networks with fixed structures, NEAT starts with simple networks and gradually adds
/// complexity through evolution. It uses genetic operators like mutation and crossover, along with speciation
/// to protect innovation, to evolve networks that solve specific problems without requiring manual design
/// of the network architecture.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> NEAT is a way to grow neural networks through evolution rather than training them with fixed structures.
/// 
/// Think of NEAT like breeding plants to get better features:
/// - Instead of designing a neural network by hand, you start with simple networks
/// - These networks "reproduce" and "mutate" over generations
/// - Networks that perform better on your task are more likely to pass on their "genes"
/// - Over time, the networks evolve complex structures that solve your problem well
/// 
/// The key differences from traditional neural networks:
/// - The structure (connections between neurons) evolves along with the weights
/// - Networks can grow more complex over time by adding new neurons and connections
/// - You work with a population of many networks, not just one
/// - Instead of training with gradient descent, you use evolution to improve performance
/// 
/// NEAT is particularly good for:
/// - Problems where you don't know the ideal network structure
/// - Reinforcement learning tasks (like game playing)
/// - Finding novel solutions that a human designer might not think of
