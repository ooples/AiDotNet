/// A Connection represents a weighted link between two nodes in a neural network. Connections are fundamental
/// elements in neural networks, allowing signals to flow from one node to another with a specific weight.
/// This class is particularly designed for use in evolutionary algorithms like NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting 
/// Topologies), which evolve both the weights and structure of neural networks. The Innovation number serves as 
/// a historical marker to track the evolutionary lineage of connections.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Connection is like a wire connecting two parts of a neural network.
/// 
/// Think of a neural network as a system of connected nodes (like neurons in a brain):
/// - Each Connection is like a wire that passes signals from one node to another
/// - The Weight determines how strong the signal is (like a volume knob)
/// - IsEnabled acts like an on/off switch for the connection
/// - The Innovation number is like a birth certificate that shows when this connection first appeared
/// 
/// For example, if node 3 connects to node 5 with a weight of 0.7, signals from node 3 will reach node 5,
/// but their strength will be multiplied by 0.7 (either amplified or reduced depending on the original value).
