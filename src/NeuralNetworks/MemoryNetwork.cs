/// answering questions based on provided context.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Memory Network is a special type of neural network that has its own "memory storage" component.
/// 
/// Think of it like a person who has:
/// - A notebook (the memory) where they can write down important facts
/// - The ability to read specific information from their notebook when needed
/// - The ability to add new information to their notebook as they learn
/// 
/// For example, if you provided a Memory Network with several facts about a topic:
/// - It would store these facts in its memory matrix
/// - When asked a question, it would search its memory for relevant information
/// - It would use this retrieved information to formulate an answer
/// 
/// Memory Networks are particularly good at:
/// - Question answering based on a given context
/// - Reasoning tasks that require remembering multiple facts
/// - Dialog systems that need to maintain conversation history
/// - Tasks where information needs to be remembered and used later
