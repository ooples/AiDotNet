/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Deep Boltzmann Machine is like a multi-story pattern detector.

/// Think of it as a series of layers, each learning increasingly abstract patterns:
/// - The visible layer represents the raw data (e.g., pixel values in an image)
/// - The first hidden layer might learn simple patterns (e.g., edges, corners)
/// - Higher hidden layers learn more complex patterns (e.g., shapes, objects)
/// - The deeper the network, the more abstract the patterns it can learn
/// 
/// For example, in an image recognition system:
/// - Layer 1 might detect edges and basic textures
/// - Layer 2 might combine these into simple shapes
/// - Layer 3 might recognize more complex objects
