/// The Transformer architecture is a type of neural network design that uses self-attention mechanisms
/// instead of recurrence or convolution. This approach allows the model to weigh the importance of 
/// different parts of the input sequence when producing each part of the output sequence.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The key components of a Transformer include:
/// - Multi-head attention layers: Allow the model to focus on different parts of the input
/// - Feed-forward networks: Process the attended information
/// - Layer normalization: Stabilize the network during training
/// - Residual connections: Help information flow through the network
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Transformer is a modern type of neural network that excels at 
/// understanding sequences of data, like sentences or time series.
/// 
/// Think of it like reading a book:
/// - When you read a sentence, some words are more important than others for understanding the meaning
/// - A Transformer can "pay attention" to different words based on their importance
/// - It can look at the entire context at once, rather than reading one word at a time
/// 
/// For example, in the sentence "The animal didn't cross the street because it was too wide",
/// the Transformer can figure out that "it" refers to "the street" by paying attention to the
/// relationship between these words.
/// 
/// Transformers are behind many recent AI advances, including large language models like GPT and BERT.
