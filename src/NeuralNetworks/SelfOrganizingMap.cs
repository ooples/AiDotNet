/// A Self-Organizing Map (SOM), also known as a Kohonen map, is a type of artificial neural network that
/// uses unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) representation
/// of higher-dimensional input data. SOMs preserve the topological properties of the input space, meaning
/// that similar inputs will be mapped to nearby neurons in the output map. This makes SOMs useful for
/// visualization, clustering, and dimensionality reduction of complex data.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Self-Organizing Map is like a smart way to arrange data on a map based on similarities.
/// 
/// Think of it like organizing books on a bookshelf:
/// - You have many books (input data) with different characteristics
/// - You want to arrange them so similar books are placed near each other
/// - Over time, you develop a system where sci-fi books are in one section, romance in another, etc.
/// 
/// A SOM works in a similar way:
/// - It takes complex data with many attributes
/// - It creates a 2D "map" where each location represents certain characteristics
/// - Similar data points end up mapped to nearby locations
/// - Different regions of the map represent different types of data
/// 
/// This is useful for:
/// - Visualizing complex data with many dimensions
/// - Finding natural groupings (clusters) in data
/// - Reducing complex data to simpler patterns
