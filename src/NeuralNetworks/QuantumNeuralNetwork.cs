/// A Quantum Neural Network (QNN) is a neural network architecture that leverages quantum computing principles
/// to potentially solve certain problems more efficiently than classical neural networks. It uses quantum bits (qubits)
/// instead of classical bits, allowing it to process information in ways not possible with traditional neural networks.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Quantum Neural Network combines ideas from quantum computing with neural networks.
/// 
/// Think of it like upgrading from a regular calculator to a special calculator with new abilities:
/// - Regular neural networks use normal bits (0 or 1)
/// - Quantum neural networks use quantum bits or "qubits" that can be 0, 1, or both at the same time
/// - This "both at the same time" property (called superposition) gives quantum networks special abilities
/// - These networks might solve certain problems much faster than regular neural networks
/// 
/// For example, a quantum neural network might find patterns in complex data or optimize solutions
/// in ways that would be extremely difficult for traditional neural networks.

/// While the math behind quantum computing is complex, you can think of a quantum neural network
/// as having the potential to explore many possible solutions simultaneously rather than one at a time.
