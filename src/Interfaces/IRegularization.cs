/// <summary>
/// Defines methods for applying regularization techniques to machine learning models.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model,
/// typically by penalizing large coefficient values.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Regularization is like adding training wheels to your AI model.
/// 
/// Imagine you're teaching a child to recognize dogs. If you only show them pictures of
/// German Shepherds, they might think only German Shepherds are dogs (this is "overfitting").
/// Regularization helps your model focus on the most important patterns and ignore "noise"
/// in the training data, making it better at generalizing to new examples.
/// 
/// Common regularization methods include:
/// - L1 (Lasso): Can zero out less important features completely
/// - L2 (Ridge): Keeps all features but makes their impact smaller
/// - Elastic Net: A combination of L1 and L2
/// 
/// Without regularization, models often perform well on training data but poorly on new data.

    /// This method applies regularization to output data or model coefficients.
    /// 
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> Model coefficients are the "importance weights" your model assigns to different features.
    /// This method helps keep these weights from getting too large, which can cause overfitting.
    /// 
    /// For example:
    /// - With L1 regularization, some coefficients might be reduced to exactly zero
    /// - With L2 regularization, all coefficients are typically reduced but remain non-zero
    /// 
    /// Think of it as encouraging your model to use simpler explanations by penalizing complex solutions.

    /// <remarks>
    /// This method modifies the gradient used in optimization algorithms to account for regularization.
    /// 
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> When a model is learning (training), it follows a "gradient" that tells it
    /// which direction to adjust its parameters to improve. This method modifies that gradient
    /// to include the regularization constraints.
    /// 
    /// It's like adding a gentle force that pulls the model toward simpler solutions during training.
    /// This helps prevent the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data.
