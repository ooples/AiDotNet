namespace AiDotNet.Interfaces;

/// <summary>
/// Defines mathematical operations for numeric types used in machine learning algorithms.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This interface provides a unified way to perform mathematical operations regardless of the
/// underlying numeric type (float, double, decimal, etc.), allowing algorithms to work with
/// different numeric types without changing their implementation.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This interface is like a translator that helps AI algorithms work with
/// different types of numbers.
/// 
/// Why is this needed?
/// - AI algorithms need to do math operations (add, multiply, etc.)
/// - Different applications might need different number types (float, double, decimal)
/// - This interface lets the same algorithm work with any number type
/// 
/// Real-world analogy:
/// Think of this interface like a universal calculator. Whether you're working with whole
/// numbers, decimals, or fractions, the calculator knows how to perform operations like
/// addition and multiplication for each type. Similarly, this interface knows how to perform
/// math operations for different numeric types used in AI.
/// 
/// When implementing AI algorithms:
/// - Instead of writing code that only works with one number type (like double)
/// - You can write code that works with this interface
/// - Then your algorithm can work with any number type that has an implementation of this interface
/// </remarks>
