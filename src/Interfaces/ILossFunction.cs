/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Loss functions measure how far the predictions of a neural network are from the expected outputs.
/// They provide a signal that helps the network learn by adjusting its weights to minimize this "loss" value.
/// 
/// Think of a loss function as a score that tells you how well or poorly your neural network is performing.
/// A higher loss value means worse performance, while a lower loss value indicates better performance.
/// 
/// Different types of problems require different loss functions. For example:
/// - Mean Squared Error is often used for regression problems (predicting numeric values)
/// - Cross Entropy is commonly used for classification problems (categorizing inputs)
/// 
/// The derivative of a loss function is equally important, as it tells the network which direction to adjust
/// its weights during training to reduce the loss.
