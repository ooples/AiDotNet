/// <summary>
/// Defines methods for normalizing and denormalizing data for machine learning models.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This interface provides functionality to transform data into a standardized range
/// (normalization) and to reverse this transformation (denormalization).
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Normalization is like converting different measurements to the same scale.
/// 
/// What is normalization?
/// - Normalization transforms your data values to a standard range (usually between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1)
/// - It's like converting different units of measurement to a common scale
/// 
/// Why normalize data?
/// - Machine learning algorithms work better with normalized data
/// - It prevents features with large values from dominating those with smaller values
/// - It helps algorithms converge faster during training
/// 
/// Real-world example:
/// Imagine you're analyzing house prices based on:
/// - Size (1,000-5,000 square feet)
/// - Number of bedrooms (1-6)
/// - Age (0-100 years)
/// 
/// Without normalization, the size feature (with values in thousands) would have much more
/// influence than the bedroom count (with values of just 1-6). Normalization puts all these
/// features on the same scale so they can be compared fairly.
/// 
/// After using your model, you'll need to "denormalize" the results to convert them back
/// to their original scale (e.g., from a normalized value back to actual dollars).
/// </remarks>

    /// This method transforms the input data to a normalized scale and returns both
    /// the normalized data and the parameters used for normalization.
    /// 
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This converts a list of numbers to a standard scale.
    /// 
    /// For example:
    /// - If your data contains ages (5, 18, 35, 62, 80), normalization might convert these to
    ///   values between 0 and 1: (0.0, 0.17, 0.4, 0.76, 1.0)
    /// - The normalization parameters (like minimum and maximum values) are also returned
    ///   so you can reverse this process later

    /// 
    /// For example:
    /// - If your data contains information about houses (columns for size, bedrooms, age, price),
    ///   each feature is normalized separately
    /// - Size values might range from 1,000-5,000 sq ft, but are converted to 0-1
    /// - Bedroom values might range from 1-6, but are also converted to 0-1

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This converts the model's internal numbers to work with your original data.
