/// <summary>
/// Defines the contract for neural network models with advanced architectural introspection capabilities.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This interface extends the basic neural network functionality with methods for accessing
/// the internal architecture and layer-wise activations of neural networks.
///
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This interface represents a neural network that can tell you about its structure.
///
/// Think of INeuralNetworkModel as a neural network with "x-ray vision" into its own structure:
/// - It can show you what each layer produces (activations)
/// - It can describe its own architecture (how it's built)
/// - It combines all the basic neural network abilities with introspection capabilities
///
/// For example, if you're debugging or analyzing a neural network:
/// - You can see what each layer outputs for a given input
/// - You can examine the network's structure (number of layers, layer types, connections)
/// - You can understand how information flows through the network
///
/// This is particularly useful for:
/// - Debugging neural networks (seeing where things go wrong)
/// - Understanding what the network has learned
/// - Visualizing how the network processes information
/// - Implementing advanced techniques like transfer learning or feature extraction
///
/// This interface is typically implemented by neural network base classes that provide
/// comprehensive access to their internal structure and computations.
/// </remarks>

    /// - The input enters the first layer
    /// - Each layer transforms the data and passes it to the next layer
    /// - The final layer produces the output

    /// This method lets you see the intermediate results at each step. For example, in an image
    /// recognition network:
    /// - Layer 1 might detect edges (its activation shows edge patterns)
    /// - Layer 2 might detect simple shapes (its activation shows shape patterns)
    /// - Layer 3 might detect object parts (its activation shows parts like eyes or wheels)
    /// - Final layer produces the classification result
    ///
    /// Each layer's name includes its position and type (e.g., "Layer_0_DenseLayer", "Layer_1_ConvolutionalLayer").
    /// This is useful for:
    /// - Visualizing what the network learned

    /// - Extracting features from intermediate layers
