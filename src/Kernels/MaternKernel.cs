/// The Matérn kernel is particularly useful because it lets you control exactly how "smooth" your model's
/// predictions will be.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of the Matérn kernel as a "similarity detector" with an adjustable sensitivity. When two points
/// are close together, the kernel gives a high similarity score. As the points get farther apart, the
/// similarity decreases. The special thing about the Matérn kernel is that you can control exactly how
/// quickly this similarity drops off and how smooth the transition is.

/// <para>
/// This kernel has two important parameters:
/// - The nu (?) parameter controls the smoothness of the function
/// - The length parameter controls how quickly the similarity decreases with distance
/// </para>

/// Common values for nu include 0.5 (which gives an exponential kernel), 1.5 (which is once differentiable),
/// and 2.5 (which is twice differentiable). The default value is 1.5, which works well for many applications.
