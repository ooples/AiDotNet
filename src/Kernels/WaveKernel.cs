/// The Wave kernel is a specialized kernel function that produces wave-like patterns in the similarity
/// space. It is based on the sinc function (sin(x)/x) and creates oscillating similarity values as the
/// distance between points increases.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Wave kernel is special because it creates a pattern of similarity that rises and falls like a wave
/// as points get farther apart. This is different from most kernels where similarity only decreases with distance.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of it like this: If you drop two stones in a pond, the Wave kernel is like measuring how the
/// ripples from each stone interact with each other. Sometimes the ripples add up (high similarity) and
/// sometimes they cancel out (low similarity), creating a wave-like pattern.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The formula for the Wave kernel is:
/// k(x, y) = sin(||x-y||/s) / (||x-y||/s)
/// where:
/// - ||x-y|| is the Euclidean distance between vectors x and y
/// - s (sigma) is a parameter that controls the width of the waves

/// Common uses include:
/// - Signal processing applications
/// - Time series analysis
/// - Problems where periodic patterns are important
