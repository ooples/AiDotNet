/// <para>
/// The Additive Chi-Squared kernel is a variation of the Chi-Squared distance measure that is
/// particularly useful for histogram comparison in image recognition, document classification,
/// and other applications where data is represented as frequency distributions.

/// The kernel is defined as K(x,y) = -log(1 + S[(x_i - y_i)²/(x_i + y_i)]) for all dimensions i.

/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a way to measure how similar two data points are to each other.
/// Think of it like a special ruler that can measure distance in complex data spaces. The Additive 
/// Chi-Squared kernel is particularly good at comparing data that represents counts or frequencies 
/// (like how many times words appear in documents, or how many pixels of each color appear in images).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Unlike regular distance measures where smaller values mean "closer" (more similar), kernel functions
/// typically return larger values for more similar items. This kernel transforms the Chi-Squared distance
/// so that more similar items have higher values.
