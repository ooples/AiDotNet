/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Probabilistic kernel is special because it considers both:
/// 1. The angle between data points (like cosine similarity)
/// 2. The difference in their magnitudes (like Gaussian kernel)
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of the Probabilistic kernel as a "smart similarity detector" that can tell if two data points
/// are pointing in similar directions AND have similar sizes. This is particularly useful when both
/// the direction and magnitude of your data are important.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The formula for the Probabilistic kernel is:
/// k(x, y) = (x·y / v(||x||²·||y||²)) · exp(-||x||² - ||y||²)²/(2s²))
/// where:
/// - x and y are the two data points being compared
/// - x·y is the dot product (a measure of how aligned the vectors are)
/// - ||x|| and ||y|| are the magnitudes (lengths) of the vectors
/// - s (sigma) is a parameter that controls sensitivity to magnitude differences
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Common uses include:
/// - Text classification where both word presence and frequency matter
/// - Image recognition where both pattern and intensity are important
/// - Any application where both direction and magnitude of data provide useful information
