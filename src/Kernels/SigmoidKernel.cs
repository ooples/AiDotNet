/// The Sigmoid kernel is derived from the neural network field and is related to the activation

/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Sigmoid kernel is special because it can capture certain types of relationships that other
/// kernels can't. It's inspired by how neurons in artificial neural networks work.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of it like this: The Sigmoid kernel looks at how two data points interact with each other
/// (their dot product) and then transforms this interaction using a special S-shaped curve (the hyperbolic
/// tangent function). This helps it detect complex patterns in your data.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The formula for the Sigmoid kernel is:
/// k(x, y) = tanh(a(x·y) + c)
/// where:
/// - x and y are the two data points being compared
/// - x·y is the dot product between them
/// - a (alpha) controls the steepness of the S-curve
/// - c is a parameter that shifts the curve horizontally
/// - tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function (an S-shaped curve)
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Common uses include:
/// - Text classification problems
/// - Some types of image recognition tasks
/// - Problems where the data might have complex, non-linear relationships
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Note: Unlike many other kernels, the Sigmoid kernel is not always positive definite, which means
/// it might not work well with all machine learning algorithms. It's most commonly used with
/// Support Vector Machines.
