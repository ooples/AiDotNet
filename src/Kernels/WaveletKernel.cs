/// wave-like oscillations that start at zero, increase, and then decrease back to zero. They are
/// particularly useful for analyzing signals at different scales.

/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Wavelet kernel is special because it uses wavelet functions, which are like little waves that can
/// detect patterns at different scales or resolutions in your data.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of it like this: If you're looking at a beach from far away, you might see big waves, but as you
/// zoom in, you'll see smaller ripples too. Wavelets can help analyze both the big waves and small ripples
/// in your data. The Wavelet kernel uses this property to measure similarity between data points.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The formula for the Wavelet kernel is:
/// k(x, y) = ? h((x_i - y_i)/a) * vc
/// where:
/// - h is the wavelet function (like the Mexican Hat wavelet)
/// - a is a dilation parameter that controls the width of the wavelet
/// - c is a scaling parameter
/// - ? means multiply all the results together for each dimension i
/// </para>

/// Common uses include:
/// - Signal processing and time series analysis
/// - Image processing and computer vision
/// - Data with multi-scale patterns
/// - Feature extraction at different resolutions
