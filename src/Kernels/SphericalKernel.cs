/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Spherical kernel is special because it has a "limited range" - if two points are too far apart
/// (farther than the sigma parameter), the kernel says they have zero similarity. This is different from
/// many other kernels that might say points have a very small similarity even when they're very far apart.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of it like this: The Spherical kernel creates a bubble of influence around each data point.
/// Points inside this bubble are considered similar (with similarity decreasing as distance increases),
/// while points outside the bubble are considered completely dissimilar.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The formula for the Spherical kernel is:
/// k(x, y) = 1.5 * (1 - ||x - y||/s) if ||x - y|| = s
/// k(x, y) = 0 if ||x - y|| > s
/// where:
/// - x and y are the two data points being compared
/// - ||x - y|| is the Euclidean distance between them
/// - s (sigma) is the radius parameter that determines the kernel's range

/// Common uses include:
/// - Spatial data analysis
/// - Geostatistics
/// - Large datasets where computational efficiency is important
