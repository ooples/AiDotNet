/// It supports multiple normalization methods, such as min-max scaling, z-score normalization, robust scaling, and

/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class stores the information needed to scale a single feature or target variable.
/// 
/// When normalizing data for machine learning:
/// - Different methods can be used (min-max scaling, z-score normalization, etc.)
/// - Each method requires specific parameters (like minimum/maximum values or mean/standard deviation)
/// - These parameters need to be saved to ensure consistent scaling
/// 
/// This class stores all those parameters for a single feature, including:
