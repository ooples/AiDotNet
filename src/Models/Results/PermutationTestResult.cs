/// <para>
/// The permutation test is a resampling method that creates a reference distribution by randomly reassigning observations 
/// to groups and recalculating the test statistic many times. This class stores the results of such a test, including 
/// the observed difference between groups, the p-value, the number of permutations performed, the count of extreme values, 
/// and whether the result is statistically significant. Permutation tests are particularly useful when the assumptions of 
/// parametric tests (like t-tests) are not met, or when dealing with small sample sizes. The class uses generic type 
/// parameter T to support different numeric types for the statistical values, such as float, double, or decimal.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class stores the results of a permutation test, which helps determine if a difference between groups is real or could have happened by chance.
/// 
/// For example, you might use this test to answer questions like:
/// - Is the difference in treatment outcomes between two groups statistically significant?
/// - Could the observed difference in test scores between teaching methods have occurred by random chance?
/// - Is the relationship between two variables stronger than would be expected by chance?
/// 
/// The test works by:
/// 1. Calculating the actual difference between your groups
/// 2. Randomly shuffling your data many times and recalculating the difference each time
/// 3. Seeing how often the random shuffles produce a difference as extreme as your actual difference
/// 
/// This approach is particularly useful when:
/// - You have small sample sizes
/// - Your data doesn't follow a normal distribution
/// - You want to avoid making assumptions about the underlying distribution
/// 
/// This class stores all the information about the test results, helping you interpret whether
/// the observed difference is statistically significant.
