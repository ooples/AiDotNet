/// <para>
/// The Chi-Square test is a statistical hypothesis test that evaluates whether observed frequencies differ significantly 
/// from expected frequencies. It is commonly used to test the independence of two categorical variables or to assess 
/// the goodness of fit between observed data and a theoretical distribution. This class stores the results of such a 
/// test, including the test statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom, observed and expected frequencies, and whether 
/// the result is statistically significant. The class uses generic type parameter T to support different numeric types 
/// for the statistical values, such as float, double, or decimal.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The Chi-Square test helps determine if there's a meaningful relationship between two categorical variables.
/// 
/// For example, you might use this test to answer questions like:
/// - Is there a relationship between gender and preference for a product?
/// - Does treatment type affect recovery rates?
/// - Are survey responses distributed as expected?
/// 
/// The test works by:
/// 1. Comparing observed frequencies (what you actually counted) with expected frequencies (what you would expect if there's no relationship)
/// 2. Calculating a statistic that measures how different these frequencies are
/// 3. Determining if this difference is statistically significant
/// 
/// This class stores all the information about the test results, helping you interpret whether
/// the observed differences are likely due to chance or represent a real association.
