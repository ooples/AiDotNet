/// <para>
/// The F-test is a statistical test used to determine whether two populations have equal variances. It is based on 
/// the ratio of two sample variances. This class stores the results of such a test, including the F-statistic, 
/// p-value, degrees of freedom, the variances being compared, confidence intervals, and whether the result is 
/// statistically significant. The F-test is commonly used in analysis of variance (ANOVA) and as a preliminary 
/// test before applying other statistical tests that assume equal variances. The class uses generic type parameter 
/// T to support different numeric types for the statistical values, such as float, double, or decimal.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The F-test helps determine if two groups have similar or different amounts of variability.
/// 
/// For example, you might use this test to answer questions like:
/// - Do men and women have the same variability in test scores?
/// - Is the precision of one measurement method better than another?
/// - Are the variances in two manufacturing processes comparable?
/// 
/// The test works by:
/// 1. Calculating the ratio of the two sample variances
/// 2. Comparing this ratio to what would be expected if the population variances were equal
/// 3. Determining if the difference is statistically significant
/// 
/// This class stores all the information about the test results, helping you interpret whether
/// the observed difference in variability is likely due to chance or represents a real difference.
