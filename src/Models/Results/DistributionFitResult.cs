/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class stores information about how well a statistical distribution matches your data.

/// - Which standard statistical distribution (like Normal, Exponential, etc.) best describes your data
/// - How well that distribution fits your data
/// - What the specific parameters of that distribution are
/// 
/// This class stores all that information after a distribution fitting process, making it easy to:
/// - Identify the best distribution for your data
/// - Compare how well different distributions fit
/// - Access the parameters needed to use the distribution for further analysis

/// For example, if your data follows a normal distribution, this class would tell you that,
/// provide a measure of how well it fits, and give you the mean and standard deviation parameters.

    /// - Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic: Based on the maximum difference between empirical and theoretical CDFs
    /// - Anderson-Darling statistic: Similar but gives more weight to the tails of the distribution
    /// - Negative log-likelihood: Based on the probability of observing your data given the distribution
