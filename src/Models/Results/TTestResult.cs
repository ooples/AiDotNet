/// <para>
/// The t-test is one of the most commonly used statistical tests for comparing means. This class stores the results of 
/// such a test, including the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and whether the result is statistically significant. 
/// The t-test is used when the test statistic follows a t-distribution under the null hypothesis, which typically occurs 
/// when comparing means from normally distributed populations with unknown variances. The class uses generic type parameter 
/// T to support different numeric types for the statistical values, such as float, double, or decimal.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class stores the results of a t-test, which helps determine if the difference between two groups is statistically significant.
/// 
/// For example, you might use a t-test to answer questions like:
/// - Is there a significant difference in test scores between two teaching methods?
/// - Does a new medication significantly change blood pressure compared to a placebo?
/// - Are the average sales before and after a marketing campaign significantly different?
/// 
/// The t-test works by:
/// 1. Calculating a t-statistic based on the difference between group means
/// 2. Determining how likely this t-statistic would occur by chance
/// 3. Producing a p-value that represents this probability
/// 
/// This test is particularly useful when:
/// - You're comparing means between two groups
/// - Your data approximately follows a normal distribution
/// - You have relatively small sample sizes
/// 
/// This class stores all the information about the test results, helping you interpret whether
/// the observed difference is statistically significant.
