/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Mann-Whitney U test (also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is a non-parametric alternative to the 
/// independent samples t-test. It's used when the data doesn't meet the assumptions required for the t-test, 
/// particularly when the data isn't normally distributed. This class stores the results of such a test, including 
/// the U statistic, Z-score, p-value, and whether the result is statistically significant. The test is commonly 
/// used to compare the medians of two groups, though it technically tests whether one sample tends to have larger 
/// values than the other. The class uses generic type parameter T to support different numeric types for the 
/// statistical values, such as float, double, or decimal.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The Mann-Whitney U test helps determine if two groups are different when you can't use a regular t-test.
/// 
/// For example, you might use this test to answer questions like:
/// - Do patients on treatment A have different recovery times than those on treatment B?
/// - Do students using one learning method score differently than those using another method?
/// - Are customer satisfaction ratings different between two product versions?
/// 
/// The test works by:
/// 1. Ranking all values from both groups together
/// 2. Calculating how much the ranks differ between groups
/// 3. Determining if this difference is statistically significant
/// 
/// This test is particularly useful when:
/// - Your data doesn't follow a normal distribution
/// - You have ordinal data (rankings) rather than continuous measurements
/// - You have outliers that might skew the results of a t-test
/// 
/// This class stores all the information about the test results, helping you interpret whether
/// the observed difference between groups is likely due to chance or represents a real difference.
