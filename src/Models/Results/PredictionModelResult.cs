    /// This static method loads a serialized model from a file at the specified path. It requires a model factory function
    /// that can create the appropriate model type based on metadata. This ensures that the correct model type is instantiated
    /// before deserialization.

    /// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This method loads a previously saved model from a file.
    /// 
    /// The LoadModel method:
    /// - Takes a file path where the model is stored
    /// - Uses the model factory to create the right type of model based on metadata
    /// - Reads the file and deserializes the data into a new PredictionModelResult object
    /// - Returns the fully loaded model ready for making predictions
    /// 
    /// The model factory is important because:
    /// - Different types of models (linear regression, neural networks, etc.) need different deserialization logic
    /// - The factory knows how to create the right type of model based on information in the saved file
    /// 
    /// For example, you might load a model with:
    /// `var model = PredictionModelResult<double, Matrix<double>, Vector<double>>.LoadModel(
    ///     "C:\\Models\\house_price_predictor.model", 
    ///     metadata => new LinearRegressionModel<double>());`
    /// </para>
    /// </remarks>
