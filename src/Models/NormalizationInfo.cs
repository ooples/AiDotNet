/// <para>
/// This class encapsulates all the information needed to normalize input features and denormalize predictions for a machine 
/// learning model. Normalization is a preprocessing technique that scales data to a standard range, which can improve the 
/// performance and stability of many machine learning algorithms. This class stores the normalizer object that performs the 
/// actual normalization operations, as well as the parameters that describe how each feature and the target variable were 
/// normalized during training.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class stores information about how data is scaled before and after prediction.
/// 
/// When working with machine learning models:
/// - Input data often needs to be scaled to a standard range (like 0-1)
/// - After prediction, the results may need to be scaled back to the original range
/// - You need to store how this scaling was done during training
/// 
/// This class stores all that information, including:
/// - The normalizer object that performs the actual scaling operations
/// - Parameters for how each input feature should be normalized
/// - Parameters for how the target variable (what you're predicting) should be denormalized
/// 
/// This ensures that new data is processed consistently with how the model was trained,
/// which is essential for accurate predictions.
