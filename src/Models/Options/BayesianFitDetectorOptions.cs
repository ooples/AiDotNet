/// <para>
/// This class provides threshold values used to interpret Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or similar
/// Bayesian metrics that assess model fit. These thresholds help determine if a model is a good fit,
/// overfit (too complex), or underfit (too simple) for the given data.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> When building AI models, it's important to know if your model is "just right" 
/// for your data. Think of it like Goldilocks choosing a bed - one can be too soft (overfit), one too hard (underfit), 
/// and one just right (good fit). This class helps set the thresholds for determining which category your model falls into.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// An overfit model is like memorizing exam answers without understanding the concepts - it works perfectly for the 
/// practice questions but fails on the actual exam. An underfit model is too simple, like using a straight line to 
/// predict stock prices that go up and down. A good fit balances complexity and generalization, capturing the important 
/// patterns without getting distracted by random noise in the data.
