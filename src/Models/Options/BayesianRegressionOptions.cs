/// Bayesian regression is a statistical approach that applies Bayes' theorem to regression analysis.
/// Unlike traditional regression which produces point estimates, Bayesian regression provides probability
/// distributions for the model parameters, allowing for uncertainty quantification in predictions.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Bayesian regression is like traditional regression (finding relationships between 
/// variables) but with an added layer of confidence information. Instead of just saying "we think y = 2x + 3," 
/// Bayesian regression says "we think y = 2x + 3, and we're 90% confident that the 2 is between 1.8 and 2.2." 
/// This approach is especially useful when you have limited data or want to incorporate prior knowledge about 
/// what the relationship might be. It helps you understand not just what the relationship is, but also how certain 
/// you can be about that relationship.</para>
