/// <para>
/// Transfer Function models extend ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models by incorporating 
/// the effects of one or more input (exogenous) time series on an output (endogenous) time series. They are 
/// particularly useful for modeling systems where there is a known causal relationship between input and output 
/// variables, with possible lagged effects. The transfer function component captures how changes in the input 
/// series affect the output series over time, while the ARIMA component models the autocorrelation structure 
/// of the output series. These models are widely used in fields such as economics, engineering, and environmental 
/// science for applications like dynamic system modeling, intervention analysis, and forecasting with leading 
/// indicators. This class provides configuration options for controlling the order of various components in the 
/// Transfer Function model.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Transfer Function models help you understand how one time series affects another over time.
/// 
/// When analyzing relationships between time series:
/// - Simple regression assumes immediate effects (X affects Y at the same time point)
/// - But in reality, effects often occur with delays (X affects Y after several time periods)
/// - The effect might also be distributed over multiple time periods
/// 
/// Transfer Function models solve this by:
/// - Capturing how input variables affect output variables over time
/// - Modeling both immediate and delayed effects
/// - Accounting for the autocorrelation in the output series itself
/// - Combining elements of regression and time series analysis
/// 
/// This approach is useful for:
/// - Understanding how marketing campaigns affect sales over time
/// - Modeling how temperature changes affect energy consumption
/// - Analyzing how policy changes impact economic indicators
/// 
/// This class lets you configure the structure of the Transfer Function model.
