/// <para>
/// GARCH models are specialized time series models designed to capture volatility clustering in financial
/// and economic data. Unlike standard time series models that focus on predicting the mean value, GARCH
/// models specifically model how the variance (volatility) of a time series changes over time, accounting
/// for periods of high and low volatility.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Think of GARCH as a specialized tool for predicting how much something will
/// fluctuate or vary in the future, rather than predicting its exact value. It's particularly useful for
/// financial data like stock prices, where you might want to know not just whether a price will go up or down,
/// but how stable or volatile it will be. For example, GARCH can help predict whether tomorrow's stock price
/// will likely stay close to today's price or might swing dramatically in either direction. This is valuable
/// for risk management and option pricing in finance. The model works by recognizing that periods of high
/// volatility often cluster together (if today is volatile, tomorrow is likely to be volatile too).</para>
