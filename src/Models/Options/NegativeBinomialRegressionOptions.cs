/// <summary>
/// Configuration options for Negative Binomial Regression, a statistical model used for count data

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Negative Binomial Regression extends Poisson regression by introducing an additional parameter
/// that allows the variance to exceed the mean, making it suitable for overdispersed count data.
/// This model is appropriate when analyzing count outcomes (like number of events, occurrences, or items)
/// that show greater variability than would be expected under a Poisson distribution. The model is
/// typically fitted using maximum likelihood estimation, optimized through iterative methods such as
/// Fisher scoring or Newton-Raphson iterations.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Negative Binomial Regression is a specialized technique for analyzing
/// count data - data where you're counting how many times something happens.
/// 
/// While Poisson regression is commonly used for count data, it assumes that the mean and variance are equal.
/// In real-world data, we often see more variability than Poisson allows for:
/// 
/// Think of it like predicting daily customer counts at a restaurant:
/// - Some days might have 50 customers, others 150, with an average of 100
/// - Poisson would expect most days to be fairly close to 100
/// - But real data often shows more extreme values (very busy days, very slow days)
/// - Negative Binomial can handle this extra variability
/// 
/// This model is particularly useful when:
/// - You're counting events (visits, purchases, accidents, etc.)
/// - Your data shows "clumping" or extra variation
/// - Some counts are much higher or lower than the average would suggest
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the model learns from your data to make accurate predictions
/// despite this extra variability.

    /// - Eventually, the improvements become very small

    /// The default value of 0.000001 (one millionth) means:
    /// - If an iteration improves the model by less than one millionth of its current quality
