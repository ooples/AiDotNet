/// <summary>
/// Configuration options for detecting autocorrelation in time series data and regression residuals.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class provides threshold values used to interpret the Durbin-Watson statistic, which measures
/// autocorrelation in the residuals (errors) of regression and time series models. The Durbin-Watson
/// statistic typically ranges from 0 to 4, with different values indicating different types of autocorrelation.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Autocorrelation is a pattern where data points in a time series are related to 
/// their own past values. Think of it like weather patterns - if it's been raining for several days, there's a 
/// higher chance it will rain tomorrow (positive autocorrelation). This class helps determine if your data has 
/// such patterns by setting thresholds for the Durbin-Watson test, which is like a thermometer for measuring 
/// autocorrelation. Values around 2 suggest no autocorrelation, values closer to 0 suggest positive autocorrelation 
/// (each value tends to be similar to previous values), and values closer to 4 suggest negative autocorrelation 
/// (each value tends to be opposite to previous values). Understanding autocorrelation helps choose the right 
/// prediction model for your data.</para>
