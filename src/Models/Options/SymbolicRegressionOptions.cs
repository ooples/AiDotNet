/// <para>
/// Symbolic Regression is a type of regression analysis that searches for mathematical expressions that best 
/// fit a given dataset, both in terms of accuracy and simplicity. Unlike traditional regression techniques 
/// that fit parameters to a predefined model structure, symbolic regression simultaneously evolves both the 
/// structure of the model and its parameters. It uses genetic programming, an evolutionary algorithm inspired 
/// by biological evolution, to evolve a population of mathematical expressions through operations like 
/// selection, crossover, and mutation. This approach can discover complex, non-linear relationships in data 
/// without requiring prior assumptions about the form of the model. This class inherits from 
/// NonLinearRegressionOptions and adds parameters specific to the evolutionary algorithm used in symbolic 
/// regression, such as population size, number of generations, and genetic operator rates.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Symbolic Regression finds mathematical formulas that explain your data.
/// 
/// When performing regression (predicting values):
/// - Traditional methods fit parameters to a predefined equation
/// - You must specify the form of the equation in advance
/// - This requires knowing what relationship to look for
/// 
/// Symbolic Regression solves this by:
/// - Automatically discovering both the structure and parameters of equations
/// - Starting with a population of random simple formulas
/// - Evolving them through "survival of the fittest"
/// - Combining good formulas to create better ones (crossover)
/// - Randomly changing formulas occasionally (mutation)
/// - Continuing until it finds a formula that fits the data well
/// 
/// This approach offers several benefits:
/// - Can discover unexpected relationships in your data
/// - Produces human-readable mathematical formulas
/// - Doesn't require prior knowledge of the underlying relationship
/// - Often finds simpler models than other techniques
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the evolutionary algorithm searches for formulas.
