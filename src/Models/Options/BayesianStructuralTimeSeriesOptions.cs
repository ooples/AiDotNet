/// Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) models are flexible time series models that decompose a time series
/// into trend, seasonal, and regression components. They use Bayesian methods to estimate model parameters
/// and can handle missing data, incorporate prior knowledge, and provide uncertainty estimates.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A time series is simply data collected over time (like daily temperatures, 
/// monthly sales, or yearly population). Bayesian Structural Time Series is a powerful way to analyze this 
/// kind of data by breaking it down into different parts: the overall direction (trend), repeating patterns 
/// (seasonality), and the influence of other factors (regression). The "Bayesian" part means it can express 
/// uncertainty about its predictions and incorporate what you already know about the data. Think of it like 
/// weather forecasting that not only predicts tomorrow's temperature but also tells you how confident it is 
/// in that prediction.</para>
