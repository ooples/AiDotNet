/// are trustworthy. Imagine a weather forecaster who predicts a 70% chance of rain - if it actually rains on 70% of the 
/// days when they make this prediction, they're well-calibrated. Similarly, we want AI models that say "I'm 90% sure" 
/// to be right about 90% of the time. This detector helps identify if your model is overconfident (saying it's very sure 
/// when it shouldn't be) or underconfident (not expressing enough confidence when it should).</para>
