/// <para>
/// Robust regression methods provide an alternative to standard least squares regression when data contains 
/// outliers or exhibits heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance in errors). Unlike ordinary least squares 
/// regression, which can be heavily influenced by outliers, robust regression methods use specialized techniques 
/// to reduce the impact of outlying observations. This class extends the standard RegressionOptions class to 
/// include additional parameters specific to robust regression algorithms, such as the tuning constant, 
/// maximum iterations for iterative reweighting procedures, convergence tolerance, weight function selection, 
/// and an optional initial regression model for initialization. These options allow fine-tuning of the robust 
/// regression algorithm to best handle the specific characteristics of the dataset being analyzed.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Robust regression helps your model handle outliers and unusual data points.
/// 
/// Standard regression can be easily thrown off by outliers (extreme values):
/// - Imagine predicting house prices where most homes are $200,000-$400,000
/// - But there's one luxury mansion worth $10 million in your data
/// - Standard regression might shift significantly to accommodate this outlier
/// 
/// Robust regression solves this problem by:
/// - Giving less weight to data points that are far from the pattern
/// - Focusing more on the typical cases that represent the true relationship
/// - Producing more reliable predictions when your data has unusual values
/// 
/// Think of it like taking a poll:
/// - Standard regression counts everyone's vote equally
/// - Robust regression gives more consideration to mainstream opinions and less to extreme views
/// 
/// This class lets you configure exactly how the robust regression algorithm handles outliers
/// and unusual data points.
