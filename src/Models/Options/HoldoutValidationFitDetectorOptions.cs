/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Holdout validation is a technique where a portion of the available data is "held out" from training
/// and used only for validation. By comparing model performance on training data versus this held-out
/// validation data, we can detect various issues like overfitting (performing much better on training
/// than validation data) or underfitting (performing poorly on both datasets).
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This detector helps you understand if your machine learning model is
/// learning properly by comparing how well it performs on data it has seen during training versus new
/// data it hasn't seen before.
/// 
/// Think of it like testing a student's understanding: if they can only answer questions they've seen
/// before but struggle with new questions on the same topic, they've memorized answers rather than
/// truly understanding the subject. Similarly, a good model should perform well not just on its training
/// data but also on new, unseen data.
/// 
/// This detector uses several thresholds to identify common problems:
/// - Overfitting: The model performs much better on training data than validation data (memorization)
/// - Underfitting: The model performs poorly on both training and validation data (not learning enough)
/// - High Variance: The model's performance varies significantly across different validation sets
/// - Good Fit: The model performs well on both training and validation data (proper learning)
/// - Stability: The model's performance is consistent across different validation sets
/// 
/// By detecting these issues early, you can adjust your model or training approach to get better results.</para>
