/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models are a generalization of univariate autoregressive models to multivariate 
/// time series. In a VAR model, each variable is modeled as a linear function of past values of itself and past 
/// values of all other variables in the system. This approach captures the dynamic relationships and feedback 
/// effects among multiple interrelated time series. VAR models are widely used in economics, finance, and other 
/// fields for forecasting, structural analysis, and policy analysis. They provide a flexible framework for 
/// analyzing the joint dynamics of multiple variables without imposing strong a priori restrictions on the 
/// relationships. This class provides configuration options for controlling the structure and estimation of 
/// VAR models.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> VAR models help you understand and forecast multiple related time series simultaneously.
/// 
/// When dealing with multiple time series that affect each other:
/// - Simple models treat each series independently
/// - But in reality, variables often influence each other over time
/// 
/// VAR models solve this by:
/// - Modeling all variables together as a system
/// - Allowing each variable to depend on past values of all variables
/// - Capturing the relationships and feedback effects between variables
/// 
/// This approach offers several benefits:
/// - Better forecasts by incorporating relationships between variables
/// - Understanding how shocks to one variable affect other variables
/// - Analyzing the dynamic interactions in a system
/// 
/// For example, in economics, VAR models might show how changes in interest rates
/// affect GDP, inflation, and unemployment over several quarters.
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the VAR model is structured and estimated.

    /// This property specifies the lag order for the VAR model, often denoted as p. The lag order determines how
