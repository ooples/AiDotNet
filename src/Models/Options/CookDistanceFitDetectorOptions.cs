/// Cook's Distance is a statistical measure that identifies how much influence each data point has on a regression model.
/// Points with high Cook's Distance values have a disproportionate effect on the model's predictions and parameters.
/// This detector analyzes the distribution of Cook's Distance values across your dataset to identify potential
/// fitting problems.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Imagine you're trying to draw a straight line through a set of points. Some points
/// might have a big effect on where you place that line - if you removed them, the line would move significantly.
/// These are called "influential points." Cook's Distance measures how influential each point is. This detector
/// looks at all your data points and checks if too many (or too few) are highly influential, which could indicate
/// problems with how well your model fits the data. If many points are influential, your model might be too simple
/// (underfitting). If very few points are influential, your model might be too complex (overfitting).</para>
