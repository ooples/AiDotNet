/// AdaBoost R2 is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees

/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is like having a team of experts
/// (decision trees) working together to solve a problem. Each expert specializes in fixing
/// the mistakes made by previous experts. The "R2" indicates this is a version designed
/// specifically for regression problems (predicting continuous values like prices or temperatures)
/// rather than classification problems (categorizing data into groups).
