/// <summary>
/// Configuration options for Poisson Regression, a specialized form of regression analysis used for modeling
/// count data and contingency tables where the dependent variable consists of non-negative integers.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Poisson Regression is particularly suited for analyzing count data where the response variable represents
/// the number of occurrences of an event within a fixed period or space. Unlike linear regression, which assumes
/// a normal distribution of errors, Poisson regression assumes the response variable follows a Poisson distribution.
/// This makes it appropriate for cases where data is discrete, non-negative, and often skewed. The model uses a 
/// logarithmic link function to ensure predictions are always positive. Poisson regression is widely used in fields
/// such as epidemiology, insurance (claim counts), ecology (species counts), and marketing (number of purchases).
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Poisson Regression is a technique specially designed for predicting counts of things.
/// 
/// Imagine you want to predict:
/// - How many customers will visit a store each hour
/// - How many calls a support center will receive each day
/// - How many defects will appear in manufactured products
/// 
/// When working with counts:
/// - You never have negative numbers (you can't have -3 customers)
/// - You often have small whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
/// - The data often clusters near zero with a "long tail" of occasional higher values
/// 
/// Regular regression methods can give nonsensical results for this kind of data (like predicting -2.5 customers).
/// Poisson regression specifically handles count data by:
/// - Always predicting non-negative values
/// - Understanding the special patterns common in count data
/// - Properly handling the case when counts are zero
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the algorithm searches for the best model to fit your count data.

    /// This parameter controls how many times the algorithm will attempt to refine the model coefficients during

    /// - It stops earlier if it finds a solution that's good enough (based on the Tolerance setting)
    /// - It stops after 100 attempts even if it hasn't found an ideal solution
    /// 
    /// Think of it like finding the lowest point in a valley while blindfolded:
    /// - You take a step in what seems like the downward direction
    /// - You check if you're lower than before
    /// - You repeat this process, gradually getting closer to the bottom
    /// - MaxIterations is like saying "I'll take at most 100 steps, then stop wherever I am"

    /// You might want more iterations (like 500 or 1000):
    /// - For complex datasets where finding the best model is difficult
    /// - When high precision is critical for your application
    /// - If you notice the model isn't converging with the default setting

    /// terminates, as further improvements would be negligible. A smaller tolerance value requires more precision
    /// and potentially more iterations, while a larger value allows for earlier termination with a less precise solution.

    /// - It's considered "close enough" to the perfect solution at this point
    /// - Further refinements would make negligible difference to predictions
    /// 
    /// Think of it like adjusting the focus on a camera:
    /// - At first, turning the focus ring makes a big difference to clarity
