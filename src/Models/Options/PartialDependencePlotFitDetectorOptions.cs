/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) visualize the relationship between a target variable and a set of input 
/// features of interest, marginalizing over the values of all other input features. The Partial Dependence 
/// Plot Fit Detector leverages these plots to assess model quality by comparing the complexity and smoothness 
/// of the learned relationships. This approach provides valuable insights into whether a model has captured 
/// meaningful patterns (good fit), is too simplistic (underfit), or has learned noise in the training data 
/// (overfit). By analyzing the characteristics of these plots across different features, the detector can 
/// provide early warnings of potential modeling issues that might not be apparent from aggregate metrics alone.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The Partial Dependence Plot Fit Detector helps identify if your model is learning properly
/// by examining how it responds to changes in individual input features.
/// 
/// Imagine you built a model to predict house prices based on features like square footage, location, and age:
/// - A partial dependence plot shows how the predicted price changes when you vary just one feature (like square footage)
///   while keeping all other features at their average values
/// 
/// These plots help reveal three common problems:
/// - Overfitting: When your model learns patterns that are too specific to your training data
///   (like a jagged, noisy relationship between square footage and price)
/// - Underfitting: When your model is too simple and misses important patterns
///   (like a flat line that shows no relationship between square footage and price)
/// - Good fit: When your model captures meaningful patterns without excess complexity
///   (like a smooth curve showing prices increasing with square footage, but at a decreasing rate)
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the detector analyzes these plots to automatically
/// identify potential fitting problems in your models.
