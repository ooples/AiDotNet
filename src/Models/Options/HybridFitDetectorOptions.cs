/// <summary>
/// Configuration options for the Hybrid Fit Detector, which combines multiple model evaluation techniques
/// to provide a comprehensive assessment of model quality.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Hybrid Fit Detector uses a combination of approaches to evaluate model fit, including comparing
/// training and validation performance, analyzing residuals, and examining model complexity. This
/// comprehensive approach provides a more robust assessment than any single method alone, helping to
/// identify overfitting, underfitting, and good fit conditions with greater confidence.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This detector is like having a team of experts evaluate your machine
/// learning model from different angles. Instead of relying on just one way to check if your model is
/// learning properly, it uses several different methods and combines their insights.
/// 
/// Think of it like a comprehensive health checkup that includes multiple tests (blood work, physical
/// exam, imaging, etc.) rather than just checking your temperature. By looking at your model from
/// multiple perspectives, the Hybrid Fit Detector can give you a more complete picture of how well
/// your model is learning and where it might be having problems.
/// 
/// The detector helps identify three common scenarios:
/// - Overfitting: Your model has "memorized" the training data but doesn't generalize well to new data
/// - Underfitting: Your model is too simple and isn't capturing important patterns in the data
/// - Good Fit: Your model has found the right balance, learning meaningful patterns that generalize well
/// 
/// This hybrid approach is especially useful when individual detection methods might give conflicting
/// signals or when you want extra confidence in your model quality assessment.</para>
