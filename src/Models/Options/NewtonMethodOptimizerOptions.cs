/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Newton's Method is a powerful optimization algorithm that leverages second-order derivatives 
/// (Hessian matrix) in addition to first-order gradients to determine optimal step directions and sizes. 
/// This approach can achieve faster convergence than first-order methods, particularly near the optimum 
/// and for well-conditioned problems. The method approximates the objective function locally as a quadratic 
/// function and steps directly toward the minimum of this approximation. This class provides configuration 
/// options to control the learning rate dynamics of the Newton optimizer, allowing for adaptive step sizing 
/// that can improve stability and convergence speed across different optimization landscapes.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Newton's Method is an advanced technique for helping AI models learn faster and more efficiently.
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to find the lowest point in a valley while blindfolded:
/// - First-order methods (like regular gradient descent) only tell you which direction is downhill
/// - Newton's Method tells you both the downhill direction AND how curved the terrain is
/// 
/// This extra information about curvature helps the optimizer:
/// - Take larger steps when the terrain is relatively flat
/// - Take smaller, more careful steps when the terrain is highly curved
/// - Often reach the lowest point in fewer steps
/// 
/// Think of it like having a more intelligent navigation system:
/// - Regular gradient descent says "go downhill"
/// - Newton's Method says "go downhill, but adjust your stride based on the terrain"
/// 
/// This method typically excels when:
/// - The optimization problem is well-behaved (smooth, not too many bumps)
/// - You need fast convergence and can afford the extra computation
/// - The problem isn't too high-dimensional
/// 
/// The settings in this class let you control how the learning rate adapts during optimization,
/// balancing between speed and stability.
