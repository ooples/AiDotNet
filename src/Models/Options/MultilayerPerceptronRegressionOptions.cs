/// <para>
/// The Multilayer Perceptron is a versatile neural network architecture capable of learning complex
/// non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden
/// layers, and an output layer. Each neuron in a layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer,
/// forming a fully connected network. The MLP learns through a process called backpropagation, where the
/// network parameters are adjusted to minimize a loss function using gradient-based optimization techniques.
/// This class provides comprehensive configuration options for the network architecture, training process,
/// activation functions, and optimization strategy.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a basic type of neural network that
/// can learn to recognize patterns and make predictions from data.
/// 
/// Think of an MLP like a system of interconnected filters that work together:
/// - The input layer receives your data (like the temperature, humidity, and pressure for weather prediction)
/// - The hidden layers process this information through a series of transformations
/// - The output layer provides the prediction (like "chance of rain: 70%")
/// 
/// As the network trains, it gradually adjusts thousands of internal settings (weights) to get better
/// at making accurate predictions. This process is similar to how a child learns to recognize animals:
/// at first they make many mistakes, but with each example, they get better at identifying the patterns
/// that distinguish a cat from a dog.
/// 
/// This class lets you configure every aspect of your neural network: how many layers it has, how it learns,
/// how quickly it adapts, and much more. The default settings provide a good starting point, but you may
/// need to adjust them based on your specific problem.
