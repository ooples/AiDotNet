/// Intervention Analysis extends time series regression by explicitly modeling the effects of known
/// interventions or events (like policy changes, marketing campaigns, or natural disasters) on a time
/// series. It combines ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling with additional
/// components that represent these interventions, allowing you to quantify their impact while accounting
/// for the underlying time series patterns.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Intervention Analysis helps you measure how specific events affected your
/// time series data. For example, if you're tracking daily sales and launched a major marketing campaign
/// on a specific date, intervention analysis can help you determine how much that campaign actually
/// boosted your sales while accounting for other factors like seasonal patterns or existing trends.
/// 
/// Think of it like trying to measure the effect of a new medication on a patient's health while
/// accounting for their normal day-to-day fluctuations in health metrics. Just looking at the raw
/// numbers before and after might be misleading - intervention analysis gives you a more accurate
/// picture of the true impact.
/// 
/// This class inherits from TimeSeriesRegressionOptions, so all the general time series regression
/// settings are also available. The additional settings specific to intervention analysis let you
/// configure how the model handles both the time series patterns and the intervention effects.</para>
