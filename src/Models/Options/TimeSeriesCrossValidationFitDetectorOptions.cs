/// Time series cross-validation is a technique for evaluating the performance and generalization ability of time 
/// series forecasting models. Unlike standard cross-validation used for non-time series data, time series 
/// cross-validation respects the temporal order of observations, typically using a rolling window or expanding 
/// window approach. This class provides configuration options for thresholds used to detect common modeling 
/// issues such as overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on validation data), 
/// underfitting (where the model performs poorly on both training and validation data), and high variance 
/// (where model performance varies significantly across different validation periods). These thresholds help 
/// automate the process of model evaluation and selection for time series forecasting tasks.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class helps you detect common problems when training time series forecasting models.
/// 
/// When building time series forecasting models:
/// - Overfitting: Model learns patterns specific to historical data that don't generalize to future data
/// - Underfitting: Model is too simple to capture important patterns in the data
/// - High variance: Model performance changes dramatically across different time periods
/// 
/// Time series cross-validation:
/// - Tests your model on multiple time periods
/// - Respects the temporal nature of the data (unlike regular cross-validation)
/// - Usually involves training on earlier data and testing on later data
/// - Helps assess how well your model will perform on future, unseen data
/// 
/// This class provides thresholds to automatically detect these issues based on
/// cross-validation results, helping you diagnose and fix model training problems.
