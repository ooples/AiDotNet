/// Configuration options for Locally Weighted Regression, a non-parametric method

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) is a memory-based technique that performs a regression
/// around a point of interest using only training data that are "local" to that point.
/// Unlike global methods that fit a single model to the entire dataset, LWR fits a separate
/// simple model for each query point by using nearby training examples weighted by their distance.
/// This allows the method to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data without
/// specifying a global functional form.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Locally Weighted Regression is like asking your neighbors for advice,
/// but giving more importance to those who live closest to you.
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to estimate house prices:
/// - Traditional regression creates one formula for the entire city
/// - Locally Weighted Regression works differently - when estimating the price of a specific house,
///   it looks primarily at similar nearby houses
/// - Houses very similar to yours get a high "weight" (strong influence)
/// - Houses quite different from yours get a low "weight" (weak influence)
/// - This helps capture neighborhood-specific patterns that might get lost in a city-wide formula
/// 
/// This approach is particularly useful when different regions of your data behave differently,
/// as it can adapt to local patterns rather than forcing a single model on everything.
/// This class allows you to configure how the "neighborhood" is defined and how the local
/// models are calculated.

    /// decreases as their distance from the query point increases. It acts as a smoothing parameter:
    /// larger values create smoother functions that average over more training examples, while
    /// smaller values create more flexible functions that can fit local variations but may be more
    /// sensitive to noise. The optimal value depends on the specific dataset and problem.

    /// when making predictions.
    /// 
    /// Think of it like defining your "local community":
    /// - A small bandwidth (like 0.1) means only very similar examples strongly influence the prediction,
    ///   creating a "tight-knit community" effect
    /// - A large bandwidth (like 10.0) means even somewhat different examples have influence,
    ///   creating a "broad community" effect
    /// 
    /// The default value of 1.0 provides a reasonable balance for many problems:
    /// - Too small: Your model might become too "choppy" and sensitive to noise
    /// - Too large: Your model might become too "smoothed out" and miss important local patterns
    /// 
    /// If your predictions seem too sensitive to small changes in input, try increasing this value.
