/// Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, 
/// where metals are heated and then slowly cooled to reduce defects. In optimization, it uses a similar approach 
/// to find the global minimum of a function by occasionally accepting worse solutions to escape local minima. 
/// The algorithm starts with a high "temperature" that allows for large random moves in the solution space, 
/// including accepting worse solutions with high probability. As the temperature decreases according to a cooling 
/// schedule, the algorithm becomes more selective, gradually focusing on promising regions of the solution space. 
/// This class provides configuration options for controlling the annealing process, including temperature parameters, 
/// iteration limits, and neighborhood generation settings. Simulated Annealing is particularly useful for complex 
/// optimization problems with many local optima where deterministic methods might get trapped.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Simulated Annealing is an optimization technique inspired by metallurgy.
/// 
/// When metalworkers want to remove defects from metals, they:
/// - Heat the metal to a high temperature (atoms move freely)
/// - Slowly cool it down (atoms gradually settle into a low-energy state)
/// 
/// Simulated Annealing works similarly to find the best solution to a problem:
/// - It starts with a high "temperature" where it makes big, sometimes random changes
/// - It gradually "cools down," making smaller, more careful adjustments
/// - This approach helps it avoid getting stuck in mediocre solutions
/// 
/// The key insight is that sometimes accepting a worse solution temporarily
/// helps you find a better solution in the long run:
/// - At high temperatures, it frequently accepts worse solutions to explore widely
/// - At low temperatures, it rarely accepts worse solutions, focusing on refinement
/// 
/// This is particularly useful for complex problems with many possible solutions,
/// like route optimization, scheduling, or parameter tuning.
/// 
/// This class lets you configure exactly how the algorithm heats, cools, and explores
