/// <para>
/// Gradient Descent is one of the most widely used optimization algorithms in machine learning. It works
/// by calculating the gradient (slope) of a loss function with respect to the model parameters, then
/// updating those parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss. This class
/// inherits from GradientBasedOptimizerOptions, so all general gradient-based optimization settings are
/// also available.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Think of Gradient Descent like finding the lowest point in a valley by
/// always walking downhill. Imagine you're standing on a hilly landscape and want to reach the lowest
/// point. You look around, figure out which direction is most steeply downhill, take a step in that
/// direction, and repeat until you can't go any lower.
/// 
/// In machine learning, the "landscape" is the error or loss function (how wrong your model's predictions
/// are), and the "lowest point" represents the best possible model parameters. Gradient descent helps your
/// model learn by repeatedly adjusting its parameters to reduce prediction errors.
/// 
/// This is the most basic form of optimization used in many machine learning algorithms, including neural
/// networks, linear regression, and logistic regression. The options in this class let you control how
/// quickly the algorithm moves downhill and how it avoids certain pitfalls during the optimization process.</para>
