/// <para>
/// Unobserved Components Models (UCM), also known as Structural Time Series Models, provide a flexible 
/// framework for decomposing time series data into distinct components that are not directly observable. 
/// These components typically include trend (long-term movement), seasonal (regular patterns at fixed 
/// intervals), cycle (irregular fluctuations of varying length), and irregular (random noise) components. 
/// UCM is particularly useful for understanding the underlying structure of time series data, forecasting, 
/// and detecting structural changes. This approach is based on state space models and is often estimated 
/// using the Kalman filter. This class provides configuration options for controlling the components 
/// included in the model and the estimation process.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Unobserved Components Models help you break down time series data into meaningful parts.
/// 
/// When analyzing time series data:
/// - It's often useful to separate the data into different components
/// - These components aren't directly observable but can be estimated
/// 
/// UCM decomposes time series into:
/// - Trend: The long-term direction (upward, downward, or stable)
/// - Seasonal: Regular patterns that repeat at fixed intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
/// - Cycle: Irregular fluctuations that don't have a fixed period
/// - Irregular: Random noise or unexplained variation
/// 
/// This approach offers several benefits:
/// - Better understanding of what drives the time series
/// - Improved forecasting by modeling each component separately
/// - Ability to detect structural changes over time
/// - Flexibility to include or exclude components based on domain knowledge
/// 
/// This class lets you configure which components to include and how to estimate them.
