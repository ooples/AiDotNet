/// <summary>
/// Configuration options for Quantile Regression, a technique that enables prediction of specific
/// quantiles of the conditional distribution rather than just the conditional mean.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Quantile Regression extends traditional regression methods by estimating conditional quantiles
/// of the response variable. While standard regression estimates the conditional mean E(Y|X),
/// Quantile Regression can estimate any conditional quantile Q(a|X) for a ? (0,1), including
/// medians (a = 0.5) and other percentiles. This technique provides a more comprehensive view of the
/// relationship between variables, allowing for the analysis of the full conditional distribution.
/// It is particularly valuable when the conditional distribution is non-Gaussian, skewed, or when
/// outliers are present. Quantile Regression is also robust to heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance)
/// and can reveal how different parts of the distribution respond differently to predictor variables.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Quantile Regression helps predict specific percentiles of possible outcomes, not just the average outcome.
/// 
/// Think about salary predictions:
/// - Regular regression might tell you "the average salary for this job is $75,000"
/// - But Quantile Regression could tell you:
///   - "10% of people in this job earn less than $50,000" (10th percentile)
///   - "Half of people in this job earn less than $70,000" (median or 50th percentile)
///   - "90% of people in this job earn less than $120,000" (90th percentile)
/// 
/// What this technique does:
/// - It focuses on specific slices of the data distribution
/// - Instead of minimizing squared errors (as in mean regression)
/// - It minimizes a different loss function that depends on which quantile you want
/// - This gives you insight into different parts of the outcome distribution
/// 
/// This is especially useful when:
/// - The outcomes aren't evenly distributed around the average
/// - You're interested in extreme cases (very high or low values)
/// - Different factors might affect different parts of the distribution differently
/// - You want to understand risk or uncertainty better
/// 
/// For example, in healthcare, knowing that a treatment reduces the risk of severe complications
/// (the high quantile) is different information than knowing it reduces the average symptom severity.
///
/// This class lets you configure how the quantile regression algorithm operates.

    /// 0.9 represents the 90th percentile, 0.1 represents the 10th percentile, and so on. Setting this
    /// value to 0.5 (the default) results in median regression, which is more robust to outliers than
    /// mean regression. Lower values (e.g., 0.1) focus on the lower tail of the distribution, while
    /// higher values (e.g., 0.9) focus on the upper tail. Different quantiles can reveal how the

    /// - Half of outcomes will likely be above your prediction
    /// - Half of outcomes will likely be below your prediction
    /// 
    /// Think of it like height predictions:
    /// - Quantile 0.5 (median): The height where half of people are taller and half are shorter
    /// - Quantile 0.9 (90th percentile): The height where only 10% of people are taller
    /// - Quantile 0.1 (10th percentile): The height where 90% of people are taller
    /// 
    /// You might choose different quantiles for different purposes:
    /// - 0.5 for a typical or central prediction (median)
    /// - 0.9 or higher when you're concerned about upper limits or worst-case scenarios
    /// - 0.1 or lower when you're concerned about lower limits or best-case scenarios
    /// - Multiple quantiles (running the model multiple times) to get a full picture of possibilities
