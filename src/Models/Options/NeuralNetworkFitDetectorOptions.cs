/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Neural Network Fit Detector provides automated detection and classification of model fit quality
/// based on configurable thresholds. It analyzes the discrepancy between training and validation performance
/// to identify issues such as underfitting (poor performance on both training and validation data) and
/// overfitting (good performance on training data but poor performance on validation data). This tool
/// helps data scientists and machine learning engineers quickly assess model quality and make informed
/// decisions about architecture adjustments, regularization techniques, or data augmentation strategies.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The Neural Network Fit Detector helps you understand if your AI model is learning properly.
/// 
/// When training an AI model, three common problems can occur:
/// - Underfitting: The model is too simple and performs poorly on all data
/// - Overfitting: The model has "memorized" the training data instead of learning general patterns
/// - Just Right: The model has learned general patterns that work well on new data
/// 
/// Imagine you're teaching someone to play chess:
/// - Underfitting is like they only learned how pieces move, but no strategies
/// - Overfitting is like they memorized specific games but can't adapt to new situations
/// - Just Right is when they learned general principles they can apply to any game
/// 
/// This class lets you set thresholds that determine:
/// - What level of error is acceptable for a "good" model
/// - When a model is considered "moderately good"
/// - When a model is performing poorly
/// - When a model shows signs of overfitting (performing much better on training data than on new data)
/// 
/// These thresholds help automatically classify models during development and training,
/// so you can quickly identify and fix issues in your neural network.
