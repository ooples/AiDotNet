/// <para>
/// Particle Swarm Optimization is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively
/// improving candidate solutions (particles) with regard to a given measure of quality. The algorithm
/// maintains a population of particles, where each particle represents a potential solution to the
/// optimization problem. Particles move through the solution space guided by their own best known position
/// and the swarm's best known position. This social interaction leads to emergent intelligence that
/// efficiently explores complex solution spaces. PSO is particularly effective for continuous optimization
/// problems and has advantages in terms of simplicity, flexibility, and minimal parameter tuning requirements.

/// Imagine you and your friends are searching for the highest point in a hilly landscape while blindfolded:
/// - Each person (particle) can only feel the height at their current position
/// - Everyone remembers the highest point they personally have found so far
/// - The group also shares information about the highest point anyone has found
/// 
/// When deciding where to step next:
/// - You consider continuing in your current direction (inertia)
/// - You're pulled toward the best spot you've personally found (cognitive component)
/// - You're also pulled toward the best spot anyone in the group has found (social component)
/// - You combine these influences to decide your next move
/// 
/// This creates a smart search pattern because:
/// - People explore different areas (maintaining diversity in the search)
/// - The group gradually converges on promising regions
/// - The method balances exploration (finding new areas) with exploitation (refining good solutions)
