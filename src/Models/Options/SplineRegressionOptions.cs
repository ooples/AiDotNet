/// Spline regression is a flexible nonlinear regression technique that fits piecewise polynomial functions 
/// (splines) to data. Unlike simple polynomial regression, which uses a single polynomial for the entire 
/// data range, spline regression divides the data into segments and fits separate polynomials to each segment, 
/// with constraints ensuring smoothness at the connection points (knots). This approach provides greater 
/// flexibility in modeling complex nonlinear relationships while avoiding the oscillatory behavior often 
/// seen with high-degree polynomials. This class provides configuration options for spline regression, 
/// including the number of knots (which determines the number of segments), the degree of the polynomial 
/// functions, and the matrix decomposition method used for solving the regression equations.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Spline regression helps model complex relationships in your data using connected smooth curves.
/// 
/// When simple linear regression isn't flexible enough:
/// - Linear regression forces a straight line through your data
/// - Polynomial regression uses a single curved line, but can behave poorly
/// - Spline regression uses multiple connected curves for more flexibility
/// 
/// Think of spline regression like drawing with multiple connected curve segments:
/// - Each segment is a polynomial curve (like a parabola)
/// - The segments connect smoothly at points called "knots"
/// - This creates a flexible curve that can adapt to different patterns in different regions
/// 
/// Benefits of spline regression:
/// - More flexible than simple lines or polynomials
/// - Avoids the wild oscillations that can happen with high-degree polynomials
/// - Can capture complex relationships while still being relatively simple to interpret
/// 
/// This class lets you configure exactly how the spline regression model will be constructed.
