/// <para>
/// TBATS is an advanced time series forecasting model designed to handle complex seasonal patterns, including 
/// multiple seasonal periods. It combines several powerful techniques: Box-Cox transformation for stabilizing 
/// variance, Fourier terms for handling multiple seasonal patterns, ARMA models for capturing short-term 
/// dependencies, and trend components with optional damping. TBATS is particularly effective for time series 
/// with multiple seasonal patterns of different lengths (e.g., daily, weekly, and yearly patterns) and can 
/// automatically select the appropriate components based on the data. This class provides configuration options 
/// for controlling the various components and optimization parameters of the TBATS model.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> TBATS is a powerful forecasting model for time series with complex seasonal patterns.
/// 
/// When forecasting time series data:
/// - Simple models struggle with multiple seasonal patterns (e.g., daily, weekly, and yearly cycles)
/// - Traditional approaches may require separate modeling for each seasonal pattern
/// 
/// TBATS solves this by:
/// - Handling multiple seasonal periods simultaneously
/// - Using Fourier series to efficiently represent seasonal patterns
/// - Transforming data to stabilize variance (Box-Cox transformation)
/// - Modeling short-term dependencies (ARMA components)
/// - Incorporating trend with optional damping
/// 
/// This approach offers several benefits:
/// - Effectively captures complex seasonal patterns
/// - Handles irregular seasonality (e.g., varying month lengths)
/// - Produces accurate forecasts for data with multiple cycles
/// - Automatically selects appropriate components
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the TBATS model analyzes and forecasts your time series data.
