/// Configuration options for Conditional Inference Trees, a statistically-driven approach to decision tree learning.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Conditional Inference Trees use statistical tests to select variables and determine split points,
/// which helps reduce selection bias toward variables with many possible split points.
/// This approach often produces more reliable and statistically sound trees compared to traditional methods.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Conditional Inference Trees are a special type of decision tree that uses 
/// statistics to make better decisions about how to split data. Regular decision trees sometimes favor 
/// certain types of data unfairly (like preferring variables with more possible values). This approach is 
/// like having a referee that makes sure the tree-building process is fair and statistically sound. 
/// The result is often a more reliable model, especially for data where some variables have many possible 
/// values and others have few.</para>
