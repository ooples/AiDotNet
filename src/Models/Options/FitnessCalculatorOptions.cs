/// The fitness calculator is responsible for computing a score that represents how well a model fits the data
/// or makes predictions. Different metrics emphasize different aspects of model performance, such as overall
/// fit, error magnitude, or prediction accuracy.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Think of the fitness calculator as a judge that scores how well your AI model
/// is performing. Just like different sports have different scoring systems (points in basketball, goals in
/// soccer), AI models can be evaluated using different metrics. Some metrics focus on how close your predictions
/// are to the actual values, while others might focus on whether your model captures the overall patterns in
/// the data. These options let you choose which scoring system to use and how to interpret the scores.</para>
