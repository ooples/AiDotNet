/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm combines the Gauss-Newton method and gradient descent
/// to efficiently solve non-linear least squares problems. It adaptively switches between the two
/// approaches depending on how well the optimization is progressing, offering both stability and speed.
/// The damping factor controls this adaptation by determining whether the algorithm behaves more like
/// gradient descent (higher damping) or more like Gauss-Newton (lower damping).
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is a powerful technique for training
/// AI models that need to make accurate predictions. It works by repeatedly adjusting the model's
/// internal settings (parameters) to reduce prediction errors.
/// 
/// Think of it like tuning a musical instrument:
/// - You listen to how "off" the sound is (the error)
/// - You make small adjustments to the tuning pegs
/// - You check if the sound improved or got worse
/// - You keep adjusting until the instrument sounds right
/// 
/// The "damping factor" controls how boldly or cautiously the algorithm makes adjustments:
/// - Higher damping = smaller, more careful adjustments (slower but more stable)
/// - Lower damping = larger, more aggressive adjustments (faster but potentially unstable)
/// 
/// The algorithm automatically adjusts this damping factor as it progresses, becoming more
/// aggressive when things are going well and more cautious when improvements are hard to find.
/// This class allows you to configure how this damping behaves during training.
