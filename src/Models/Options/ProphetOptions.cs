/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Prophet is a forecasting procedure developed by Facebook (now Meta) that decomposes time series into several components:
/// trend, seasonality, holiday effects, and error. It is designed to handle time series with strong seasonal patterns, 
/// missing values, outliers, and shifts in the trend. Prophet works particularly well with time series that have
/// strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. The model automatically detects changes in trends 
/// by selecting changepoints from the data, while also allowing manual specification of known changepoints. 
/// Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. 
/// It is particularly useful for business and economic time series that are affected by holidays and seasonal patterns.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Prophet is a powerful tool for predicting future values in time-based data.
///
/// Imagine you're trying to forecast your company's sales for the next few months:
/// - Sales might follow patterns that repeat yearly (holiday shopping seasons)
/// - They might follow weekly patterns (higher on weekends, lower on Mondays)
/// - There might be special days that affect sales (Black Friday, Cyber Monday)
/// - The overall trend might be growing, shrinking, or changing direction occasionally
///
/// What Prophet does:
/// - It breaks down your data into separate pieces (components):
///   - Base trend: The overall direction (growing or declining)
///   - Seasonality: Repeating patterns (yearly, weekly, daily)
///   - Holiday effects: Impacts of special days
///   - Changepoints: Where the trend changes direction
///
/// Think of it like weather forecasting:
/// - It looks at historical patterns
/// - It accounts for seasons and special events
/// - It combines these patterns to predict what will happen next
///
/// The benefit of Prophet is that it automatically handles many complex aspects of time series forecasting
/// that would otherwise require significant expertise. This class lets you configure how Prophet analyzes 
/// and forecasts your time series data.
