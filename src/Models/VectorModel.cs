/// This class implements a simple linear model where predictions are made by computing the dot product of the input 
/// features and a vector of coefficients. It provides methods for training the model using linear regression, 
/// evaluating predictions, and genetic algorithm operations like mutation and crossover. This model is useful for 
/// linear regression problems and can serve as a building block for more complex models.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This is a simple linear model that makes predictions by multiplying each input by a weight and adding them up.
/// 
/// When using this model:
/// - Each input feature has a corresponding coefficient (weight)
/// - Predictions are made by multiplying each input by its coefficient and summing the results
/// - The model can be trained using linear regression on example data
/// - It supports genetic algorithm operations for optimization
/// 
/// For example, if predicting house prices, the model might learn that:
/// price = 50,000 � bedrooms + 100 � square_feet + 20,000 � bathrooms
