/// Implements the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose a matrix into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R.

/// <remarks>
/// The Gram-Schmidt process transforms a set of vectors into a set of orthogonal vectors (vectors that are perpendicular to each other).
/// This decomposition is useful for solving linear systems, computing least squares solutions, and other numerical applications.
/// 
/// In simple terms, this class takes a matrix and breaks it down into two special matrices:
/// - Q: A matrix with perpendicular columns (orthogonal matrix)
/// - R: An upper triangular matrix (only has values on and above the diagonal)
/// 
/// Together, these matrices can be multiplied to get back the original matrix: A = Q * R
