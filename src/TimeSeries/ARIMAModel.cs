/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// ARIMA models are widely used for time series forecasting. The model combines three components:
/// - AR (AutoRegressive): Uses the dependent relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations
/// - I (Integrated): Uses differencing of observations to make the time series stationary
/// - MA (Moving Average): Uses the dependency between an observation and residual errors from a moving average model
/// </para>
/// 
/// <para>
/// For Beginners:
/// ARIMA is a popular technique for analyzing and forecasting time series data (data collected over time, 
/// like stock prices, temperature readings, or monthly sales figures).
/// 
/// Think of ARIMA as combining three different approaches:
/// 1. AutoRegressive (AR): Looks at past values to predict future values. For example, today's
///    temperature might be related to yesterday's temperature.
/// 2. Integrated (I): Transforms the data to make it easier to analyze by removing trends.
///    For example, instead of looking at temperatures directly, we might look at how they
///    change from day to day.
/// 3. Moving Average (MA): Looks at past prediction errors to improve future predictions.
///    For example, if we consistently underestimate temperature, we can adjust for that.
/// 
/// The model has three key parameters (p, d, q):
/// - p: How many past values to look at (AR component)
/// - d: How many times to difference the data (I component)
/// - q: How many past prediction errors to consider (MA component)
/// </para>
