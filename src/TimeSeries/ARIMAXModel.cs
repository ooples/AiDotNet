/// ARIMAX extends the ARIMA model by including external (exogenous) variables that might influence the time series.
/// The model combines:
/// - AR (AutoRegressive): Uses the dependent relationship between an observation and lagged observations
/// - I (Integrated): Uses differencing to make the time series stationary
/// - MA (Moving Average): Uses the dependency between an observation and residual errors
/// - X (eXogenous): Incorporates external variables that may influence the time series
/// </para>
/// 
/// <para>
/// For Beginners:
/// ARIMAX is an advanced technique for forecasting time series data (data collected over time like
/// daily temperatures, stock prices, or monthly sales) that takes into account both the history of
/// the series itself AND external factors that might influence it.
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// - Basic forecasting might just look at past sales to predict future sales
/// - ARIMAX also considers things like holidays, promotions, or economic indicators that might affect sales
/// 
/// The model has four components:
/// 1. AutoRegressive (AR): Uses past values of the series itself (like yesterday's temperature to predict today's)
/// 2. Integrated (I): Transforms the data by looking at differences between values to remove trends
/// 3. Moving Average (MA): Looks at past prediction errors to improve future predictions
/// 4. eXogenous (X): Includes external factors that might affect the series (like whether it's a holiday)
/// 
/// The "X" is what makes ARIMAX different from ARIMA - it can include information from outside the time series itself.
