/// - AR (AutoRegressive): Uses the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations

/// <para>
/// For Beginners:
/// The ARMA model is a popular method for analyzing and forecasting time series data
/// (data collected over time, like daily temperatures, stock prices, or monthly sales).
/// 
/// Think of ARMA as combining two different approaches:
/// 1. AutoRegressive (AR): This component predicts future values based on past values.
///    For example, tomorrow's temperature might be related to today's temperature.
///    If it's hot today, it's likely to be hot tomorrow as well.
/// 
/// 2. Moving Average (MA): This component predicts future values based on past prediction errors.
///    For example, if we consistently underestimate temperature, the MA component
///    helps adjust our future predictions upward.
/// 
/// The model has two key parameters:
/// - p: The AR order - how many past values to consider
/// - q: The MA order - how many past prediction errors to consider
/// 
/// Unlike ARIMA, ARMA doesn't include the differencing (I) component, so it works
/// best with time series data that is already stationary (doesn't have strong trends).
