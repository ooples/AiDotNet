/// Represents a model that implements exponential smoothing for time series forecasting.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Exponential smoothing is a time series forecasting method that assigns exponentially decreasing weights
/// to past observations, giving more importance to recent data while still considering older observations.
/// This model supports simple, double (with trend), and triple (with trend and seasonality) exponential smoothing.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Exponential smoothing helps predict future values based on past data.
/// 
/// Think of it like predicting tomorrow's weather:
/// - Recent weather (yesterday, today) is more important than weather from weeks ago
/// - You can identify trends (getting warmer over time)
/// - You can account for seasons (summer is usually warmer than winter)
/// 
/// For example, if you're forecasting daily sales:
/// - Simple smoothing: Uses a weighted average of past values, giving more weight to recent sales
/// - Double smoothing: Also captures if sales are trending up or down
/// - Triple smoothing: Adds seasonal patterns (e.g., higher sales on weekends)
/// 
/// Exponential smoothing is called "exponential" because the weight given to older data
/// decreases exponentially as the data gets older.
