/// The Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model is a powerful and flexible approach for analyzing
/// and forecasting time series data. It decomposes a time series into interpretable components
/// including level, trend, seasonality, and regression effects, using Bayesian methods to handle
/// uncertainty and combine information from different sources.
/// </para>
/// 
/// <para>
/// For Beginners:
/// A Bayesian Structural Time Series model is like having a flexible toolkit for forecasting time series data.
/// Unlike simpler models like AR or ARIMA that use fixed patterns, BSTS breaks down your data into
/// meaningful components:
/// 
/// 1. Level: The current "baseline" value of your series
/// 2. Trend: Whether your data is generally increasing or decreasing over time
/// 3. Seasonal patterns: Regular cycles in your data (daily, weekly, yearly, etc.)
/// 4. Effects of external factors: How other variables influence your data
/// 
/// The "Bayesian" part means the model handles uncertainty well. Instead of making single point predictions,
/// it gives you a range of possible outcomes with probabilities attached. It uses something called a
/// "Kalman filter" to continually update its understanding as new data arrives.
/// 
/// BSTS models are especially powerful because they:
/// - Can handle missing data
/// - Allow you to incorporate external information
/// - Provide predictions with uncertainty ranges
/// - Let you see which components are driving your forecast
/// 
/// This makes them ideal for analyzing complex time series where you want to understand
/// what's driving changes in addition to making predictions.
