/// Represents a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model for time series with changing volatility.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The GARCH model is specifically designed for time series data that exhibits volatility clustering, where periods of high 
/// volatility are followed by periods of high volatility, and periods of low volatility are followed by periods of low volatility.
/// It combines a mean model (typically an ARIMA model) with a variance model that captures the conditional heteroskedasticity.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> GARCH models help predict both the value and the uncertainty of financial data.
/// 
/// Think of it like weather forecasting:
/// - Regular forecasting predicts the temperature (the mean value)
/// - GARCH also predicts how much the temperature might vary (the volatility)
/// 
/// For example, with stock prices:
/// - Some days, prices barely change (low volatility)
/// - Other days, prices swing wildly up and down (high volatility)
/// - Often, volatile periods tend to cluster together (volatility clustering)
/// 
/// GARCH helps model this behavior by:
/// - Using one model to predict the average price (mean model)
/// - Using another model to predict how much prices might fluctuate (volatility model)
/// 
/// This is especially useful for financial risk management, option pricing, and trading strategies.
