/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A matrix is simply a rectangular grid of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
/// When working with data in programming, we need to specify how our data is organized.
/// 
/// Think of a spreadsheet:
/// - You can organize your data by putting similar features in columns (ColumnArrays)
/// - Or you can organize your data by putting each data point across a row (RowArrays)
/// 
/// For example, if you have data about people (height, weight, age):
/// 
/// ColumnArrays would look like:
/// - First array: [height1, height2, height3, ...]
/// - Second array: [weight1, weight2, weight3, ...]
/// - Third array: [age1, age2, age3, ...]
/// 
/// RowArrays would look like:
/// - First array: [height1, weight1, age1]
/// - Second array: [height2, weight2, age2]
/// - Third array: [height3, weight3, age3]
/// 
/// The choice of layout affects how you access and process your data, and different
/// algorithms may expect data in different layouts.
/// </para>
