/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Activation functions are mathematical operations that determine whether a neuron in a 
/// neural network should be "activated" (output a signal) or not.
/// 
/// Think of a neuron as a decision-maker that:
/// 1. Receives multiple inputs
/// 2. Calculates a weighted sum of these inputs
/// 3. Applies an activation function to decide what value to output
/// 
/// Without activation functions, neural networks would just be linear models (like basic regression), 
/// unable to learn complex patterns. Activation functions add non-linearity, allowing networks to learn 
/// complicated relationships in data.
/// 
/// Different activation functions have different properties that make them suitable for different tasks. 
/// Choosing the right activation function can significantly impact how well your neural network learns 
/// and performs.
