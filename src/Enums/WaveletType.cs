/// <summary>
/// Defines the different types of biorthogonal wavelets that can be used for signal processing and analysis.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Wavelets are mathematical functions that cut up data into different frequency components.
/// 
/// Think of wavelets like special lenses that let you look at your data in different ways:
/// - They can zoom in to see fine details (high frequencies)
/// - They can zoom out to see the big picture (low frequencies)
/// 
/// Biorthogonal wavelets (Bior) are a special family of wavelets that have useful properties for 
/// signal processing. The "Reverse" prefix indicates these are the reconstruction filters.
/// 
/// The numbers in each wavelet name (like "11" in ReverseBior11) represent:
/// - First number: Decomposition filter length
/// - Second number: Reconstruction filter length
/// 
/// Different wavelets are better suited for different types of data and applications.
/// </remarks>
