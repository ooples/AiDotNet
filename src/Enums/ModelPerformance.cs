    /// Indicates that the model performs well on the given data, with high accuracy and reliability.

    /// A "Good" performance typically means the model makes predictions that closely match the actual values,
    /// with metrics like R² generally above 0.8 (or equivalent thresholds for other metrics).

    /// <para>
    /// A "Moderate" performance suggests the model captures some patterns in the data but misses others.
    /// It's usable but could benefit from refinement, with metrics typically in the middle ranges
    /// (e.g., R² between 0.5 and 0.8).

    Moderate,

    /// Indicates that the model performs poorly and may not be suitable for the given data or task.

    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// A "Poor" performance means the model struggles to make accurate predictions, with metrics showing
    /// low values (e.g., R² below 0.5). This could indicate that the model needs significant improvements,
    /// more training data, or that a different type of model might be more appropriate for the task.
