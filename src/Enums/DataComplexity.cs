/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Data complexity refers to how difficult it is for a machine learning model to find patterns in your data.
/// 
/// Think of it like solving puzzles:
/// - Simple data is like a basic jigsaw puzzle with few, large pieces
/// - Complex data is like an advanced puzzle with many tiny pieces and subtle patterns
/// 
/// Understanding your data's complexity helps you choose the right model:
/// - Simple data often works well with basic models
/// - Complex data usually requires more sophisticated models
/// 
/// This enum helps you categorize your data to make better decisions about which algorithms to use.

    /// Simple data typically has these characteristics:
    /// - Linear or easily separable patterns
    /// - Few relevant features (typically less than 10)
    /// - Clear relationships between inputs and outputs
    /// - Minimal noise or outliers
    /// - Little to no missing data
    /// - Balanced classes (for classification problems)

    /// Examples include:
    /// - Height vs. weight relationships
    /// - Basic customer segmentation with clear groups
    /// - Simple time series with obvious trends

    /// Moderate complexity data typically has these characteristics:
    /// - Somewhat non-linear patterns
    /// - Moderate number of features (typically 10-50)
    /// - Some feature interactions
    /// - Moderate amount of noise
    /// - Some missing data

    /// - Customer purchase prediction with demographic and behavioral data
    /// - Housing price prediction with multiple factors
    /// - Seasonal time series with multiple patterns
