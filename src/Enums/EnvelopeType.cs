/// <b>For Beginners:</b> An envelope in data analysis is like drawing a line that follows the peaks or valleys of your data.
/// 
/// Think of it like tracing the outline of a mountain range:
/// - The upper envelope follows the tops of the mountains (the highest points)
/// - The lower envelope follows the bottoms of the valleys (the lowest points)
/// 
/// Envelopes are useful for:
/// - Identifying trends in noisy data
/// - Finding the boundaries of oscillating signals
/// - Detecting peaks and valleys in time series data
/// - Creating confidence intervals around predictions
/// 
/// For example, if you have stock price data that goes up and down, the upper envelope would connect all the highest prices,
/// while the lower envelope would connect all the lowest prices.
/// </para>
