/// Specifies different loss functions and fitness calculators for evaluating model performance.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Loss functions and fitness calculators measure how well your AI model's predictions match the actual data.
/// 
/// Think of these metrics like grades on a test:
/// - They tell you how well your model is performing
/// - Different metrics focus on different aspects of performance
/// - For most loss functions, lower values mean better performance
/// - For some metrics (like R-squared), higher values mean better performance
/// 
/// When building AI models, you need ways to:
/// - Compare different models to choose the best one
/// - Know when to stop training your model
/// - Understand if your model is actually learning useful patterns
/// - Detect if your model is overfitting (memorizing data instead of learning)
/// 
/// Different metrics are better for different situations, so it's common to look at multiple metrics
/// when evaluating a model.
