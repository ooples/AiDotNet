/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Bidiagonal decomposition is a technique used in linear algebra and machine learning 
/// to simplify complex matrices (tables of numbers) into a special form that makes further calculations easier.
/// 
/// A bidiagonal matrix is a special type of matrix where non-zero values appear only on the main diagonal 
/// (from top-left to bottom-right) and either just above or just below this diagonal. All other values are zero.
/// 
/// This decomposition is often used as a step in solving systems of equations, finding eigenvalues, 
/// or performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms 
/// like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), recommendation systems, and image compression.
/// 
/// Think of it like simplifying a complex recipe into basic steps that are easier to follow - 
/// the bidiagonal form makes complex matrix operations more manageable.
/// 
/// This enum lists different mathematical approaches to perform this decomposition, each with its own 
/// advantages in terms of accuracy, speed, or memory usage.

    /// Continuing with our furniture analogy, while Householder moves multiple pieces at once, 
    /// the Givens method is like rearranging the room by moving just two pieces of furniture at a time.

    /// 
    /// This precision makes Givens rotations particularly useful for sparse matrices (matrices with 
    /// mostly zero values) or when you need to preserve certain structures in your matrix. It might 
    /// take more individual steps than Householder, but each step is simpler and can be more efficient

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Lanczos method is an iterative approach that is particularly efficient for 
    /// very large, sparse matrices (huge tables with mostly zero values).
    /// 
    /// In our furniture analogy, if you had an enormous warehouse with just a few pieces of furniture 
    /// scattered throughout (a large sparse matrix), the Lanczos method would be like having a map that 
    /// takes you directly to each piece without having to check every empty space.
    /// 
    /// This method is especially valuable in machine learning and data science when dealing with very 
    /// large datasets, as it can find approximate solutions much faster than the other methods. It's 
    /// particularly useful when you don't need the exact decomposition but a good approximation is sufficient.
