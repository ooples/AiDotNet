/// <summary>
/// Represents different algorithm types for Beveridge-Nelson decomposition of time series data.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Beveridge-Nelson decomposition is a technique used in economics and finance to separate 
/// time series data (like stock prices or GDP over time) into two main components:
/// 
/// 1. Permanent Component (Trend) - The long-lasting changes that persist indefinitely
/// 2. Temporary Component (Cycle) - The short-term fluctuations that eventually fade away
/// 
/// Unlike other decomposition methods that might look at regular patterns (like seasonality), 
/// Beveridge-Nelson focuses on distinguishing between changes that will have lasting effects 
/// versus those that will eventually reverse.
/// 
/// For example, when analyzing a company's stock price:
/// - A permanent component might be fundamental improvements in the company's business model
/// - A temporary component might be short-term market excitement that will eventually subside
/// 
/// This enum lists different algorithmic approaches to performing this type of decomposition.

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Standard approach implements the original Beveridge-Nelson method as described

    /// flowing in the same direction) and its eddies and whirlpools (temporary fluctuations that eventually
    /// dissipate).

    /// patterns in your time series.
    /// 
    /// Think of it as using a high-powered microscope instead of a magnifying glass - you can see more
    /// details and make better distinctions between what's permanent and what's temporary in your data.
