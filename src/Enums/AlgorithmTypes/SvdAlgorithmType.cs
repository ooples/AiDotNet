/// Represents different algorithm types for Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a powerful mathematical technique that breaks down a matrix 
/// (which you can think of as a table of numbers) into three simpler component matrices. It's like taking apart a 
/// complex machine to understand how it works.
/// 
/// Here's what SVD does in simple terms:
/// 
/// 1. It takes a matrix A and decomposes it into three matrices: U, S (Sigma), and V^T
///    A = U × S × V^T
/// 
/// 2. Each of these matrices has special properties:
///    - U contains the "left singular vectors" (think of these as the basic patterns in the rows of A)
///    - S is a diagonal matrix containing the "singular values" (think of these as importance scores)
///    - V^T contains the "right singular vectors" (think of these as the basic patterns in the columns of A)
/// 
/// Why is SVD important in AI and machine learning?
/// 
/// 1. Dimensionality Reduction: SVD helps compress data by keeping only the most important components
/// 
/// 2. Noise Reduction: By removing components with small singular values, we can filter out noise
/// 
/// 3. Recommendation Systems: SVD powers many recommendation algorithms (like those used by Netflix)
/// 
/// 4. Image Processing: It's used for image compression and facial recognition
/// 
/// 5. Natural Language Processing: SVD is used in techniques like Latent Semantic Analysis
/// 
/// 6. Data Visualization: It can help reduce high-dimensional data to 2D or 3D for visualization
/// 
/// This enum specifies which specific algorithm to use for computing the SVD, as different methods have different 
/// performance characteristics and may be more suitable for certain types of matrices or applications.

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Golub-Reinsch algorithm is the "classic" method for computing SVD. It's like the 
    /// standard recipe that has been trusted for decades.
    /// 
    /// This algorithm works in two main steps:
    /// 
    /// 1. First, it reduces the original matrix to a bidiagonal form (a simpler matrix with non-zero elements 
    ///    only on the main diagonal and the diagonal just above it)
    /// 
    /// 2. Then, it iteratively computes the SVD of this bidiagonal matrix
    /// 
    /// The Golub-Reinsch approach:
    /// 
    /// 1. Is numerically stable (gives accurate results even with challenging matrices)
    /// 
    /// 2. Works well for small to medium-sized dense matrices
    /// 
    /// 3. Has predictable performance across different types of matrices
    /// 
    /// 4. Is well-studied and understood
    /// 
    /// 5. Computes the full SVD (all singular values and vectors)
    /// 
    /// This method is particularly useful when:
    /// 
    /// 1. You need high accuracy
    /// 
    /// 2. Your matrix is dense and not too large
    /// 
    /// 3. You need all singular values and vectors
    /// 
    /// 4. You want a reliable, well-tested approach
    /// 
    /// In machine learning applications, the Golub-Reinsch algorithm provides a solid foundation for techniques 
    /// like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where accuracy in computing the decomposition is important.

    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Jacobi algorithm takes a different approach to computing SVD by using a series of 
    /// rotations to gradually transform the matrix.
    /// 
    /// Imagine you're trying to align a crooked picture frame. The Jacobi method is like making a series of small 
    /// adjustments, rotating it bit by bit until it's perfectly straight:
    /// 
    /// 1. It looks for the largest off-diagonal element in the matrix
    /// 
    /// 2. It applies a rotation to make that element zero
    /// 
    /// 3. It repeats this process many times until all off-diagonal elements are very close to zero
    /// 
    /// The Jacobi approach:
    /// 
    /// 1. Is extremely accurate, often more precise than other methods
    /// 
    /// 2. Works particularly well for small matrices
    /// 
    /// 3. Is easy to parallelize (can use multiple processors efficiently)
    /// 
    /// 4. Converges more slowly for large matrices
    /// 
    /// 5. Is simpler to understand and implement than some other methods

    /// 2. You're working with small matrices
    /// 
    /// 3. You have parallel computing resources available
    /// 
    /// 4. The matrix has special properties (like being symmetric)
    /// 
    /// In machine learning applications, the Jacobi algorithm can be useful for sensitive applications where

    /// 
    /// 2. It then computes the SVD of this much smaller matrix
    /// 
    /// 3. Finally, it converts this result back to an approximate SVD of the original matrix
    /// 
    /// The Randomized approach:
    /// 
    /// 1. Is much faster than classical methods for large matrices
    /// 
    /// 2. Requires less memory
    /// 
    /// 3. Provides an approximation rather than an exact result
    /// 
    /// 4. Works particularly well when the matrix has rapidly decaying singular values

    /// 5. Can be tuned to balance speed versus accuracy
    /// 
    /// This method is particularly useful when:

    /// 1. You're working with very large matrices
