/// <summary>
/// Represents different algorithm types for computing the polar decomposition of matrices.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Polar decomposition is a way to break down a matrix into two simpler parts - 
/// one that represents pure rotation/reflection (an orthogonal matrix) and one that represents pure stretching 
/// (a positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix).
/// 
/// Think of it like this: When you transform an object in 3D space, you might rotate it AND stretch it. 
/// Polar decomposition separates these two actions:
/// 
/// 1. The rotation/reflection part (like turning a book to face a different direction)
/// 2. The stretching part (like making the book wider or taller)
/// 
/// Mathematically, if A is your original matrix, polar decomposition gives you A = UP, where:
/// - U is an orthogonal matrix (pure rotation/reflection)
/// - P is a positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix (pure stretching)
/// 
/// Why is this useful in AI and machine learning?
/// 
/// 1. Computer Vision: Helps understand how images are transformed
/// 
/// 2. Robotics: Useful for understanding movement and orientation
/// 
/// 3. Data Transformation: Can help interpret how data is being transformed by algorithms
/// 
/// 4. Numerical Stability: Some algorithms become more stable when using polar decomposition
/// 
/// 5. Dimensionality Reduction: Can help in understanding the geometric meaning of transformations
/// 
/// This enum specifies which specific algorithm to use for computing the polar decomposition, as different 
/// methods have different performance characteristics depending on the matrix properties.

    /// <para>
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is a powerful technique that breaks down any matrix

    /// Imagine you have a complex photo editing filter. SVD is like figuring out that this filter is actually 
    /// three simpler filters applied one after another. Once you know these three filters, you can extract just 
    /// the parts you want (like just the rotation).
    /// 
    /// The SVD method:
    /// 
    /// 1. Is very stable and accurate
    /// 
    /// 2. Works for any matrix (even non-square ones)

    /// 3. Gives you additional information beyond just the polar decomposition
    /// 
    /// 4. Is computationally expensive for very large matrices
    /// 
    /// In machine learning, SVD is widely used for dimensionality reduction (like in PCA - Principal Component Analysis),

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Newton-Schulz method is an iterative approach that starts with an initial guess and

    /// Think of it like homing in on a target: you make an educated guess, see how far off you are, adjust your 
    /// aim, and try again. Each iteration gets you closer to the bullseye.

    /// The Newton-Schulz method:
    ///

    /// 2. Uses a simple formula that's easy to implement

    /// 3. Has quadratic convergence (gets much more accurate with each iteration)

    /// 4. Works best when the matrix is not too ill-conditioned (doesn't have extreme stretching in some directions)
    /// 
    /// 5. Can be easily parallelized for faster computation
