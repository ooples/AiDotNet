/// <summary>
/// Represents different algorithm types for Takagi factorization of complex symmetric matrices.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Takagi factorization is a special type of matrix decomposition that works specifically 
/// with complex symmetric matrices. A complex symmetric matrix is a square matrix that equals its own 
/// transpose, even when the elements are complex numbers.
/// 
/// In simple terms, Takagi factorization breaks down a complex symmetric matrix A into:
/// 
/// A = U × D × U^T
/// 
/// Where:
/// - U is a unitary matrix (similar to a rotation in higher dimensions)
/// - D is a diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers
/// - U^T is the transpose of U
/// 
/// This factorization is useful in quantum physics, signal processing, and various machine learning 
/// applications where complex data needs to be analyzed.
/// 
/// Different algorithms can be used to compute this factorization, each with its own advantages 
/// and trade-offs in terms of speed, accuracy, and memory usage.
