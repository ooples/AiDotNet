/// Represents different algorithm types for additive decomposition of time series data.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Additive decomposition is a technique used to break down time series data 
/// (data collected over time, like daily temperatures or monthly sales) into separate components:
/// 
/// 1. Trend - The long-term direction of the data (going up, down, or staying flat over time)
/// 2. Seasonality - Regular patterns that repeat at fixed intervals (like higher sales during holidays)
/// 3. Residual - The random fluctuations left after accounting for trend and seasonality
/// 
/// It's called "additive" because we assume these components add together to form the original data:
/// Original Data = Trend + Seasonality + Residual
/// 
/// This enum lists different algorithms that can perform this decomposition, each with its own
/// approach to separating these components.

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Moving Average method works by calculating averages over fixed windows of time
    /// to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends. It's like looking at the 
    /// "big picture" by averaging out the day-to-day noise in your data.
    /// 
    /// For example, instead of looking at daily sales which might vary a lot, a 7-day moving average
    /// would give you the average sales for each 7-day period, creating a smoother line that makes
    /// the overall trend easier to see.

    /// Imagine you're analyzing ice cream sales over several years. Not only do sales increase in summer
