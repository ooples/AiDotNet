/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> The Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP filter) is a mathematical tool used to separate a time series 
/// into two components: a smooth trend component and a cyclical component.
/// 
/// Imagine you're looking at a chart of stock prices that goes up and down every day but also has a general 
/// upward trend over time. The HP filter helps separate:
/// 
/// 1. The long-term trend (like a smooth line showing the general direction)
/// 2. The short-term fluctuations (the daily ups and downs)
/// 
/// This is extremely useful in AI and machine learning for:
/// 
/// - Economic analysis: Separating business cycles from long-term economic growth
/// - Signal processing: Removing noise from meaningful signals
/// - Time series forecasting: Understanding underlying patterns in data
/// - Anomaly detection: Identifying unusual events that deviate from the trend
/// 
/// The HP filter works by finding a balance between two goals:
/// 
/// 1. Making the trend component fit the original data well
/// 2. Making the trend component as smooth as possible
/// 
/// A parameter called lambda (?) controls this balance - higher values create a smoother trend line, 
/// while lower values make the trend follow the original data more closely.
/// 
/// This enum specifies which specific algorithm to use for implementing the HP filter, as different methods 
/// have different performance characteristics depending on the data size and structure.

    /// until eventually it's as clean as it can get. Similarly, this method starts with a rough estimate 
    /// of the trend and cyclical components and refines them with each iteration.
    ///
