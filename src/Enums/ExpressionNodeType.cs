    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> A Constant is simply a fixed number that doesn't change, like the number 5 or 3.14.

    /// <para>
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> A Variable is a value that can change, like a placeholder that gets filled in with

    /// <para>
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> An Add node takes two or more values and adds them together. For example,

    /// <para>
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> A Subtract node takes two values and subtracts the second from the first. For example,

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> A Divide node takes two values and divides the first by the second. For example,
