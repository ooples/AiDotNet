description: Convert Super AI Prompt v5.docx to Markdown format
---

Convert the Word document at `C:\Users\yolan\OneDrive\Documents\Super AI Prompt v5.docx` to Markdown format and save it as `Super AI Prompt v5.md` in the same directory.

Follow these steps:
1. Use the Word MCP tools to read the document structure and text
2. Extract all content including headings, paragraphs, lists, and formatting
3. Convert to proper Markdown format:
   - Headings should use # syntax
   - Bold text should use **text**
   - Italic text should use *text*
   - Lists should use - or 1. syntax
   - Preserve paragraph structure
4. Save the converted content to `C:\Users\yolan\OneDrive\Documents\Super AI Prompt v5.md`
5. Show a preview of the first few lines of the converted Markdown

The user will manually save the Word document after running this command - this command just performs the conversion.
