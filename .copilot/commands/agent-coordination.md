# User Story Implementation - Expert Agent Coordination (v4.6.4)

## How to Interpret This Command

This command uses bash-like syntax throughout to clearly express logical flow, conditions, and operations. As an AI assistant, you should interpret the **INTENT** of each instruction and implement it using methods appropriate for your environment.

**Interpretation Guide**:
- `if [ -f "file.txt" ]` → Check if file exists
- `if [ -n "$VARIABLE" ]` → Check if variable is set/not empty
- `for item in list` → Iterate over items in the list
- `VARIABLE="value"` → Store and track this value in your context
- `grep pattern file` → Search for pattern in file
- Bash commands in code blocks → Execute equivalent operations in your environment

**Important**: The bash syntax is **pseudocode** showing WHAT to do, not necessarily HOW to do it in your specific CLI environment. You may need to adapt the approach based on your available tools and capabilities.

**Cross-CLI Compatibility**: This command is designed to work across multiple AI CLI tools (Claude Code, Google Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI). Each tool should interpret the instructions and implement them using their available capabilities.

## Command Arguments

**Usage**: `/agent-coordination [options]`

**Options**:
- `--category <category>` - Filter by category: `bug_fixes`, `new_features`, or `code_improvements`
- `--priority <priority>` - Filter by priority: `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`
- `--phase <number>` - Run specific phase: `1` (Bug Fixes), `2` (Code Improvements), or `3` (New Features)
- `--story <id>` - Run single user story by ID (e.g., `us-bf-002`)
- `--fix-prs` - **NEW v4.4**: Fix existing PRs (merge conflicts + Copilot comments) instead of creating new ones
- `--require-coverage <percent>` - **NEW v4.4**: Minimum code coverage required (default: 90%)

**Examples**:
```bash
/agent-coordination --category bug_fixes           # Run only bug fix user stories
/agent-coordination --priority Critical            # Run only Critical priority stories
/agent-coordination --category bug_fixes --priority High  # High priority bug fixes only
/agent-coordination --phase 1                      # Run Phase 1 (Bug Fixes)
/agent-coordination --story us-bf-002              # Run single user story
/agent-coordination --fix-prs                      # Fix all open PRs (conflicts + Copilot comments)
/agent-coordination --require-coverage 95          # Require 95% code coverage minimum
/agent-coordination                                # Run all user stories (default)
```

**Argument Parsing**:

When this command is invoked, parse the arguments after `/agent-coordination` to determine which user stories to process and what mode to run in.

**Initialize the following variables** (track these throughout execution):
- `CATEGORY_FILTER` = empty (no category filter by default)
- `PRIORITY_FILTER` = empty (no priority filter by default)
- `PHASE_FILTER` = empty (no phase filter by default)
- `STORY_FILTER` = empty (no story filter by default)
- `FIX_PRS_MODE` = false (default: create new PRs)
- `REQUIRE_COVERAGE` = 90 (default: 90% minimum code coverage)

**Parse arguments from the command invocation**:
- If `--category <value>` is present → set `CATEGORY_FILTER` to the value (must be: `bug_fixes`, `new_features`, or `code_improvements`)
- If `--priority <value>` is present → set `PRIORITY_FILTER` to the value (must be: `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`)
- If `--phase <number>` is present → set `PHASE_FILTER` to the number (must be: `1`, `2`, or `3`)
- If `--story <id>` is present → set `STORY_FILTER` to the ID (e.g., `us-bf-002`)
- If `--fix-prs` flag is present → set `FIX_PRS_MODE` to true
- If `--require-coverage <percent>` is present → set `REQUIRE_COVERAGE` to the percent value
- If an unknown argument is encountered → display error and stop

**Display the active filters** (after parsing):
- If `CATEGORY_FILTER` is set → display "Filter: Category = {value}"
- If `PRIORITY_FILTER` is set → display "Filter: Priority = {value}"
- If `PHASE_FILTER` is set → display "Filter: Phase = {value}"
- If `STORY_FILTER` is set → display "Filter: Story = {value}"
- If `FIX_PRS_MODE` is true → display "Mode: Fix existing PRs (merge conflicts + Copilot comments)"
- Always display "Code Coverage Requirement: {REQUIRE_COVERAGE}% minimum"

## Context
- User stories location: ~/.claude/user-stories/{PROJECT_NAME}/
- **IMPORTANT**: User stories are stored globally, not in the working directory
- Review tracking log: {WORKING_DIRECTORY}\review-log.md
- Progress tracking: {WORKING_DIRECTORY}/worktrees/[us-xxx]/progress-manifest.json
- Agents implement changes directly (NO proposal system)
- **NEW v4.0**: Parallel execution using git worktrees for 3-5x faster implementation
- **NEW v4.2**: Structured batching with progress manifest to prevent duplication and handle agent context limits
- **NEW v4.3**: Automated tooling first (10-50x faster), conditional batching only, Copilot integration
- **NEW v4.3.1**: Command-line argument filtering by category, priority, phase, or specific story
- **NEW v4.3.2**: Automatic PR verification to skip already-completed user stories (prevents duplicate work)
- **NEW v4.3.3**: Improved pre-flight checks with branch verification first to prevent merge conflicts
- **NEW v4.3.4**: Mandatory agent verification step to reject agents with build failures or incomplete work
- **NEW v4.3.6**: Production readiness check to reject placeholder/stub code and ensure real implementations
- **NEW v4.3.7**: Enhanced code quality checks for performance anti-patterns, ES6 shorthand, zero guards
- **NEW v4.3.8**: Dynamic comment retrieval - agents fetch CURRENT GitHub comments, not stale snapshots
- **NEW v4.4.0**: PR Fix Mode (`--fix-prs`) to fix existing PRs (merge conflicts + Copilot comments)
- **NEW v4.4.0**: Mandatory code coverage requirements (`--require-coverage` flag, default 90% minimum)
- **NEW v4.6.4**: CRITICAL FIXES - Pre-implementation validation, diff validation, quality gates, PR review loop, orchestrator validation, file filtering

## CRITICAL RULES

### 1. NEVER CLOSE PULL REQUESTS (ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION)
**THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL RULE - VIOLATION IS UNACCEPTABLE**

```
🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY RULE - READ CAREFULLY 🚨

YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED FROM CLOSING PULL REQUESTS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, CLOSE A PULL REQUEST.
NEVER use: gh pr close
NEVER use: gh api repos/.../pulls/N -X PATCH -f state=closed
NEVER use any command that closes a PR

YOU MAY ONLY:
✅ CREATE pull requests (gh pr create)
✅ UPDATE pull requests with new commits (git push)
✅ COMMENT on pull requests (gh pr comment)
✅ REQUEST reviews on pull requests (gh pr edit --add-reviewer)
✅ VIEW pull request status (gh pr view, gh pr list)

YOU MAY NEVER:
❌ CLOSE pull requests (gh pr close, API calls to close)
❌ MERGE pull requests (gh pr merge) - ONLY user can merge
❌ APPROVE pull requests (gh pr review --approve) - ONLY human reviewers can approve
❌ REJECT pull requests (gh pr review --request-changes) - ONLY for commenting, not closing

WHY THIS RULE EXISTS:
- Pull requests represent work that needs HUMAN REVIEW before merging
- Closing a PR without user permission destroys the review workflow
- PRs may have unmerged work that would be lost if closed
- Only the USER has authority to decide when a PR should be closed
- This is a critical safety measure that MUST be respected

IF YOU ARE EVER UNSURE:
- ASK THE USER FIRST
- NEVER assume you have permission to close a PR
- When in doubt, DO NOT CLOSE

VERIFICATION CHECK:
Before running ANY gh pr command, verify it does NOT contain:
- "close"
- "state=closed"
- "merge"
If it does, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user for permission.
```

**Pre-Command Verification Required:**
Before executing ANY GitHub PR command, you MUST:
1. Read the command completely
2. Verify it does NOT close, merge, or approve PRs
3. If uncertain, ask user for explicit permission
4. Log the command you're about to run and why

**Examples of FORBIDDEN commands:**
```bash
# ❌ NEVER DO THIS - FORBIDDEN
gh pr close 3
gh pr merge 5
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/7 -X PATCH -f state=closed
gh pr review 2 --approve

# ✅ ALLOWED - These are safe
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..." --reviewer github-copilot[bot]
gh pr view 3
gh pr list
gh pr comment 5 --body "Updated with fixes"
git push origin feature-branch
```

### 2. Pre-Flight Git Workflow (MANDATORY)
**BEFORE** launching any agent, execute these steps:
```bash
# Step 1: Checkout main/master branch
git checkout master  # or main, detect which exists

# Step 2: Pull latest changes
git pull origin master

# Step 3: Verify clean state
git status  # Should be clean
```

### 3. Strict Scope Adherence (MANDATORY)
- Agent must ONLY fix what's explicitly listed in the user story
- If user story says "fix 60 TS6133 errors in 25 files" - ONLY touch those 25 files
- **IGNORE** all other build errors from other files/branches
- Do NOT try to fix everything
- Do NOT fix errors outside the user story scope

### 4. NO SCRIPTS ALLOWED (MANDATORY)
- ❌ NEVER use Python scripts
- ❌ NEVER use bash scripts for code changes
- ❌ NEVER use automated tools
- ✅ ALWAYS use Edit tool manually for each change
- ✅ Make changes one file at a time
- Success rate with scripts is 0% - DO NOT USE THEM

### 5. Success Criteria (MANDATORY)
- User story changes must build with ZERO errors
- User story changes must meet 100% of acceptance criteria
- **Other files CAN have errors - that's OK**
- Only verify the files mentioned in the user story
- Create PR only when user story work is 100% complete

### 6. Base Branch Detection
- Detect main branch: `git branch -a | grep -E 'master|main'`
- Use whichever exists (master or main)
- Default to master if both exist

## Execution Phases (Sequential - Priority Order)
1. **Phase 1: Bug Fixes** - All bug fix user stories from bug_fixes/ (HIGHEST PRIORITY - blocks compilation)
2. **Phase 2: Code Improvements** - All improvement user stories from code_improvements/ (SECOND PRIORITY - quality/maintainability)
3. **Phase 3: New Features** - All new feature user stories from new_features/ (LAST - enhancements)

**Rationale**:
- Bug fixes must come first as they block compilation and prevent other work
- Code improvements improve quality and maintainability before adding new features
- New features are implemented last on a stable, high-quality codebase

**Note**: This is the correct priority order. Do not adjust unless user explicitly requests it.

## Quality Checklist (Non-Negotiable)
Each user story must meet ALL criteria before acceptance:
- [ ] User story files build with zero errors (other files can have errors)
- [ ] 100% of acceptance criteria met (from user story)
- [ ] Changes made ONLY to files listed in user story
- [ ] Git commit created with proper message
- [ ] Pull request created with detailed description
- [ ] Branch created from latest master/main

**MANDATORY Code Coverage** (NEW v4.4.0 - ALWAYS REQUIRED):
- [ ] Code coverage ≥ ${REQUIRE_COVERAGE}% (default: 90% minimum)
- [ ] Coverage tests executed and passing
- [ ] Coverage report generated and verified

**Optional** (if specified in user story):
- [ ] Linting passes (only if user story requires it)
- [ ] Unit tests written (only if user story requires it)
- [ ] All tests pass (only if user story requires it)

## Process

### Step 0: Mode Detection (FIRST - Check for --fix-prs mode)

**NEW v4.4.0 / Updated v4.7.0**: If `--fix-prs` flag is set, use PR Fix Mode instead of normal user story mode.

**v4.7.0 Updates**:
- Uses GraphQL API for accurate unresolved comment detection (`isResolved` field)
- Fixed merge conflict commit logic (proper handling of conflicts-only, comments-only, and both scenarios)
- Added senior developer intervention on iteration 3+ (orchestrator directly fixes code if agent fails repeatedly)

```bash
if [ "$FIX_PRS_MODE" = true ]; then
  echo "=========================================="
  echo "PR FIX MODE ACTIVATED (v4.7.0)"
  echo "=========================================="
  echo "This mode will fix existing open PRs by:"
  echo "  1. Resolving merge conflicts"
  echo "  2. Addressing GitHub Copilot review comments (using GraphQL API for accuracy)"
  echo "  3. Senior developer intervention on iteration 3+"

## Agent Task: Fix PR #$PR_NUMBER - Iteration $ITERATION

### 🚨 CRITICAL: NEVER CLOSE/MERGE/APPROVE PRs

### Working Directory
{WORKING_DIRECTORY}/worktrees/PR-$PR_NUMBER/

### Current Issues
$([ "$CONFLICTS_EXIST" = "true" ] && echo "- ⚠️ Merge conflicts with main branch")
$([ "$COMMENTS_EXIST" = "true" ] && echo "- ⚠️ $CURRENT_UNRESOLVED unresolved Copilot comments")

### Commit Strategy (IMPORTANT - Follow Exactly)

**Scenario 1: ONLY merge conflicts (no comments)**
\`\`\`bash
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main
# Resolve conflicts using Read + Edit tools
git add .
git commit -m "chore: resolve merge conflicts with main"
git push --force-with-lease
\`\`\`

**Scenario 2: ONLY Copilot comments (no conflicts)**
\`\`\`bash
# Fix all comments using Read + Edit tools
git add .
git commit --amend --no-edit  # Amend existing commit
git push --force-with-lease
\`\`\`

**Scenario 3: BOTH conflicts AND comments**
\`\`\`bash
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main
# Resolve conflicts using Read + Edit tools
# Also fix all Copilot comments in the same commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts and address Copilot review comments"
git push --force-with-lease
\`\`\`

### Retrieve UNRESOLVED Comments (GraphQL API - ACCURATE)

Use GraphQL to get ONLY truly unresolved comments:

\`\`\`bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query {
    repository(owner: "{owner}", name: "{repo}") {
      pullRequest(number: $PR_NUMBER) {
        headRefOid
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            comments(first: 1) {
              nodes {
                path
                line
                body
                commit { oid }
                author { login }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
'
\`\`\`

Then filter for:
- \`isResolved == false\`
- \`commit.oid == headRefOid\` (current HEAD)
- \`author.login\` matches "copilot"

### Success Criteria
- Merge conflicts resolved (if any)
- ALL unresolved Copilot comments fixed
- Proper commit message based on scenario
- Changes pushed to remote

### Iteration Context
This is iteration $ITERATION of $MAX_ITERATIONS.
- If you succeed: PR is clean ✅
- If you fail: Iteration $((ITERATION+1)) will retry
- If iteration 3 fails: Senior developer takes over

Report final HEAD commit SHA when complete.

**CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS (v4.3.3)**:
- **Branch Check First**: Verifies current branch BEFORE any git operations
- **Safe Branch Switching**: Uses `git checkout -f` to discard conflicts from previous failed operations
- **Stash Protection**: Automatically stashes uncommitted changes to preserve work
- **Conflict Prevention**: Force checkout prevents merge conflicts when switching from feature branches
- **Double Verification**: Checks for uncommitted changes both before and after pull
- **Clear Feedback**: Numbered steps with status indicators for better visibility

**Why This Matters**:
- Previous version could create merge conflicts if left on a feature branch
- This version safely handles ANY starting branch state
- Prevents the "Automatic merge failed" error from happening

**CRITICAL**: Do not proceed until main branch is checked out and up to date.

### Step 2: Discovery and Filtering

- Detect current working directory and set {WORKING_DIRECTORY}
- Extract project name from {WORKING_DIRECTORY} path (e.g., "token-optimizer-mcp")
- Read all user stories from ~/.claude/user-stories/{PROJECT_NAME}/
  - bug_fixes/*.md
  - code_improvements/*.md
  - new_features/*.md
  - Parse index.md for organized story list
- **Filter Out Already-Completed User Stories** (NEW - v4.3.2):
  ```bash
  # Skip user stories that are already complete (from Step 1 pre-flight checks)
  FILTERED_STORIES=()
  for story in "${USER_STORIES[@]}"; do
    STORY_ID=$(basename "$story" | sed 's/\.md$//' | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')
    # Check if this story ID is in COMPLETED_STORIES array
    if [[ ! " ${COMPLETED_STORIES[@]} " =~ " ${STORY_ID} " ]]; then
      FILTERED_STORIES+=("$story")
    else
      echo "  ⏭ Skipping $STORY_ID (already completed in merged PR)"
    fi
  done
  USER_STORIES=("${FILTERED_STORIES[@]}")

  echo ""
  echo "Remaining user stories to implement: ${#USER_STORIES[@]}"
  ```
- **Filter Out User Stories Already Implemented** (ENHANCED - Checks Both Open and Merged PRs):
  ```bash
  echo ""
  echo "Checking for existing/merged PRs to prevent duplicates..."

  # Get BOTH open AND recently merged PRs (last 30 days)
  OPEN_PRS=$(gh pr list --state open --base ${BASE_BRANCH} --json number,title,body --limit 100)

  done
  USER_STORIES=("${FILTERED_STORIES_NO_DUPLICATES[@]}")

  echo ""
  echo "User stories after duplicate/completion check: ${#USER_STORIES[@]}"

  ```
- Categorize by phase (Phase 1: Bug Fixes, Phase 2: Code Improvements, Phase 3: New Features)
- Create {WORKING_DIRECTORY}\review-log.md file to track all user story statuses
- Detect project type and commands (package.json, .csproj, etc.)
- Create detailed todo list for current phase (or filtered selection)

### Step 2.5: Validate .gitignore for Worktree Safety (NEW - Prevents Contamination)

**Purpose**: Ensure temporary files won't be accidentally committed by agents

```bash
echo ""
echo "Step 2.5: Validating .gitignore patterns..."

# Required patterns to prevent contamination
REQUIRED_PATTERNS=(
  ".worktrees/"
  "worktrees/"
  "fix-*.ps1"
  "*-FINDINGS.md"
  "*-INVESTIGATION.md"
  "*-update-plan.md"
  "*-report.md"
  "CRITICAL_*.md"
  "TESTING_*.md"
  "PUBLISH_*.md"
)

GITIGNORE_UPDATED=false

for pattern in "${REQUIRED_PATTERNS[@]}"; do
  # Check if pattern exists in .gitignore (escape special chars for grep)
  if ! grep -q "^${pattern}$" .gitignore 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "  ⚠️  Adding missing .gitignore pattern: $pattern"
    echo "$pattern" >> .gitignore
    GITIGNORE_UPDATED=true
  fi
done

if [ "$GITIGNORE_UPDATED" = true ]; then
  echo "  ✅ Updated .gitignore with required patterns"

  # Commit .gitignore updates
  git add .gitignore
  git commit -m "chore: add missing .gitignore patterns for agent coordination

Prevents accidental commit of:
- Worktree directories
- Temporary PowerShell scripts
- Investigation/findings markdown files

  echo "  📝 Committed .gitignore updates"
else
  echo "  ✅ .gitignore already has all required patterns"
fi
```

### Step 3: Worktree Creation and Setup (Parallel Setup)

For each user story, create a git worktree:

```bash
# Example for 3 user stories
git worktree add worktrees/us-bf-001 -b fix/us-bf-001-remove-unused "$MAIN_BRANCH"
git worktree add worktrees/us-bf-002 -b fix/us-bf-002-type-conversions "$MAIN_BRANCH"
git worktree add worktrees/us-bf-003 -b fix/us-bf-003-null-safety "$MAIN_BRANCH"

# Verify worktrees created
git worktree list
```

**Result**: Each user story has its own isolated working directory and branch

### Step 3.1: Setup ESLint with Autofix (TypeScript/JavaScript Projects)

**IMPORTANT**: For TypeScript/JavaScript projects, ALWAYS ensure ESLint is configured with autofix:

```bash
# Detect if this is a TypeScript/JavaScript project
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
  echo "Detected JavaScript/TypeScript project"

  # Check if ESLint is already configured
  if [ ! -f ".eslintrc.json" ] && [ ! -f ".eslintrc.js" ] && ! grep -q '"eslint"' package.json; then
    echo "ESLint not found - installing and configuring..."

    # Install ESLint and TypeScript plugins
    npm install --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

    # Create .eslintrc.json configuration
    cat > .eslintrc.json <<'EOF'
{
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2022,
    "sourceType": "module",
    "project": "./tsconfig.json"
  },
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"],
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": ["error", {
      "argsIgnorePattern": "^_",
      "varsIgnorePattern": "^_"
    }],
    "no-unused-vars": "off"
  },
  "env": {
    "node": true,
    "es2022": true
  }
}
EOF

    # Add lint script to package.json if not present
    if ! grep -q '"lint"' package.json; then
      # Use jq to add lint script, or manual edit if jq not available
      if command -v jq &> /dev/null; then
        jq '.scripts.lint = "eslint . --ext .ts,.js"' package.json > package.json.tmp
        jq '.scripts["lint:fix"] = "eslint . --ext .ts,.js --fix"' package.json.tmp > package.json
        rm package.json.tmp
      else
        echo "Note: Add 'lint' and 'lint:fix' scripts to package.json manually"
      fi
    fi

    echo "✓ ESLint configured with autofix support"

    # Commit ESLint configuration
    git add .eslintrc.json package.json package-lock.json 2>/dev/null || true
    git commit -m "chore: setup ESLint with autofix for automated code quality

Added ESLint configuration to enable automated fixing of:
- Unused variables
- Unused imports
- Code style issues

This enables faster automated fixes before using AI agents.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

  else
    echo "✓ ESLint already configured"
  fi

  # Verify ESLint can run
  if npx eslint --version &> /dev/null; then
    echo "✓ ESLint verified working"
  else
    echo "⚠ ESLint installation may have issues"
  fi
fi
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Automated tools are 10-50x faster than AI agents for simple fixes
- ESLint with `--fix` can resolve most unused variable/import issues instantly
- This setup only runs once and applies to all future user stories
- If ESLint already exists, this step is skipped (no overhead)

### Step 3.5: Analyze User Stories and Choose Implementation Strategy (NEW in v4.3)

For EACH user story, analyze complexity and try automated tools FIRST:

```bash
# For each user story
cd worktrees/[us-xxx]/

# 1. Read user story to understand the work
USER_STORY_PATH=~/.claude/user-stories/{PROJECT_NAME}/bug_fixes/[us-xxx].md
STORY_TYPE=$(grep -oE "(unused variables|unused imports|formatting|linting|type errors)" "$USER_STORY_PATH" | head -1)

# 2. Mark story as in-progress (NEW - v4.6.5)
STORY_ID=$(basename "$USER_STORY_PATH" | sed 's/\.md$//' | cut -d- -f1-3 | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')
if [ -f "$HOME/.claude/scripts/user-stories-manager.sh" ]; then
  bash "$HOME/.claude/scripts/user-stories-manager.sh" update "$STORY_ID" "in-progress" "$USER_STORY_PATH"
  echo "  ✓ Marked $STORY_ID as in-progress"
fi

# 2. Count files and items from user story
FILES_COUNT=$(grep -oE "[0-9]+ files?" "$USER_STORY_PATH" | head -1 | grep -oE "[0-9]+")
ITEMS_COUNT=$(grep -oE '[0-9]+ (TS[0-9]+|errors?|CS[0-9]+)' "$USER_STORY_PATH" | head -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+')

echo "User Story Analysis:"
echo "  Type: $STORY_TYPE"
echo "  Files: $FILES_COUNT"
echo "  Items: $ITEMS_COUNT"
```

**Step A: Try Automated Tools First (NEW in v4.3)**

    continue
  else
    echo "⚠ Automation PARTIAL - $REMAINING_ERRORS issues remain"
    echo "→ Will use agent to complete remaining work"
  fi
fi
```

**Step B: Determine Agent Strategy (only if automation didn't fully work)**

```bash
# Automation didn't work or only partially worked - need agents
# Determine if single agent or batching needed

# IMPORTANT: Always try SINGLE AGENT first - only batch if it fails
NEEDS_BATCHING=false
echo ""
echo "Attempting single agent implementation first..."
echo "If agent hits context limit, will create batches dynamically"
```

**If agent hits context limit (dynamic batching):**

Only create batching structure AFTER an agent reports context limit or fails to complete.

1. **Create Progress Manifest**
   ```bash
   # Create progress-manifest.json in worktree
   cat > worktrees/[us-xxx]/progress-manifest.json <<EOF
   {
     "userStory": "US-XXX",
     "title": "[User story title]",
     "totalWork": {
       "files": $FILES_COUNT,
       "items": $ITEMS_COUNT,
       "description": "[description from user story]"
     },
     "sessions": [],
     "completed": {
       "files": [],
       "count": 0
     },
     "remaining": {
       "files": [/* all files from user story */],
       "count": $FILES_COUNT,
       "items": $ITEMS_COUNT,
       "estimatedSessions": $((FILES_COUNT / 6 + 1))
     },
     "batches": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "status": "pending",
         "files": [/* first 6-8 files */],
         "itemsToFix": $((ITEMS_COUNT / NUM_BATCHES))
       },
       /* ... more batches */
     ]
   }
   EOF
   ```

2. **Split Files into Batches**
   ```bash
   # Optimal batch size: ~6-8 files or ~15 items per batch
   BATCH_SIZE=6
   NUM_BATCHES=$(( (FILES_COUNT + BATCH_SIZE - 1) / BATCH_SIZE ))

   echo "Creating $NUM_BATCHES batches of ~$BATCH_SIZE files each"
   ```

3. **Create Batch Instruction Files**
   For each batch, create `batch-N-instructions.md` with:
   - Explicit list of files for THIS batch only
   - "DO NOT Touch" section listing files from other batches
   - Success criteria specific to this batch
   - Verification commands
   - Progress percentage calculation

4. **Update Execution Strategy**
   - Will launch agents SEQUENTIALLY per batch (not all at once)
   - Each batch completion verified before next starts
   - Progress tracked in manifest after each batch

**If batching NOT needed:**

- Proceed with single agent for entire user story
- No manifest needed
- Use standard Step 4 workflow

### Step 4: Agent Implementation (Batched or Parallel Execution)

**For Large User Stories (with batching):**

Execute batches SEQUENTIALLY. For each batch:

1. **Load Batch Instructions**
   ```bash
   # Read batch-N-instructions.md for specific file list
   cd worktrees/[us-xxx]/
   cat batch-$BATCH_ID-instructions.md
   ```

2. **Launch Agent for This Batch Only**
   ```markdown
   ## Agent Task: Implement US-XXX - Batch $BATCH_ID of $TOTAL_BATCHES

   ### Your Specific Assignment
   Fix issues ONLY in these files:
   [Explicit file list from batch-N-instructions.md]

   ### DO NOT Touch These Files
   [List all files from other batches]

   ### Progress Context
   - Previous batches: [list completed batches] ✅
   - Current batch: Batch $BATCH_ID ⬅️ YOU ARE HERE
   - Remaining batches: [list pending batches]

   ### Success Criteria for This Batch
   - All files in YOUR batch have 0 errors
   - Previous batch files still have 0 errors (smoke test)
   - Exactly N items fixed in this batch
   - Progress manifest updated

   [Include all standard rules: no scripts, manual Edit tool, etc.]
   ```

3. **Wait for Batch Completion**

4. **Verify Batch Results**
   ```bash
   # Check batch files are clean
   npm run build 2>&1 | grep -E "(file1|file2|...)" | grep "error"
   # Should be 0

   # Smoke test: previous batches still clean
   npm run build 2>&1 | grep -E "(prev-files)" | grep "error"
   # Should be 0
   ```

5. **Update Progress Manifest**
   ```bash
   # Mark batch as complete, add session details
   jq '.batches[$BATCH_ID-1].status = "complete"' progress-manifest.json
   jq '.sessions += [{"sessionId": $SESSION, ...}]' progress-manifest.json
   ```

6. **Commit Batch Progress**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit --amend -m "WIP: US-XXX Batch $BATCH_ID complete ($PROGRESS% done)"
   ```

7. **Repeat for Next Batch**
   If more batches remaining, return to step 1 for next batch

8. **Final Assembly** (after all batches complete)
   ```bash
   # Amend all batch commits into final commit
   git add .
   git commit --amend -m "[final commit message per template]"

   # Push and create PR
   git push -u origin [branch]
   gh pr create --title "[US-XXX]: [title]" --body "[detailed PR description]" --base master
   ```

**For Small User Stories (no batching):**

Launch ALL agents in PARALLEL, each with its own worktree.

For each user story, launch an implementation agent with this template:

```markdown
## Agent Task: Implement [US-XXX]

### 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY RULES - READ FIRST 🚨

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NEVER CLOSE PULL REQUESTS:**
```
YOU ARE FORBIDDEN FROM CLOSING, MERGING, OR APPROVING PULL REQUESTS.

NEVER use these commands:
❌ gh pr close
❌ gh pr merge
❌ gh api ... -f state=closed
❌ gh pr review --approve

YOU MAY ONLY:
✅ gh pr create (create new PRs)
✅ gh pr comment (add comments)
✅ gh pr view (view PR details)
✅ git push (update PR with new commits)

ONLY THE USER CAN CLOSE, MERGE, OR APPROVE PULL REQUESTS.

If you are ever unsure about a command, ASK THE USER FIRST.
```

### Your Role
You are an implementation expert. Your job is to:
1. Read the user story completely
2. Make ONLY the changes specified in the user story
3. Use Edit tool manually for each change
4. Verify your changes build successfully
5. Create git commit and pull request (but NEVER close, merge, or approve it)

### Working Directory
{WORKING_DIRECTORY}/worktrees/[us-xxx]/

**IMPORTANT**: You are working in a git worktree - an isolated working directory on its own branch.
- Main repo: {WORKING_DIRECTORY}
- Your worktree: {WORKING_DIRECTORY}/worktrees/[us-xxx]/
- Your branch: fix/us-xxx-[description]
- Other agents are working in parallel in their own worktrees - you won't conflict

### User Story
Read the full user story from: ~/.claude/user-stories/{PROJECT_NAME}/bug_fixes/[US-XXX].md

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:

1. **Read User Story First**
   - Read the ENTIRE user story file
   - Note which files are listed as "Files Affected"
   - Note the exact acceptance criteria
   - Note the exact changes required

2. **Strict Scope Adherence**
   - ONLY modify files listed in "Files Affected" section
   - ONLY fix the specific issues mentioned in the user story
   - Do NOT fix other errors you see
   - Do NOT modify other files
   - Stay laser-focused on ONLY what the user story asks for

   **CRITICAL - Understanding Scope Keywords**:
   - When user story says "REMAINING errors" → Fix ALL remaining errors of that type, not just some
   - When user story says "ALL errors" → Fix every single error mentioned, 100% completion
   - When user story says "these 5 files" → Fix ONLY those 5 files, no more, no less
   - When user story says "partial implementation" → Complete the work, don't just analyze it

   **Common Scope Misinterpretations to AVOID**:
   - ❌ User story: "Fix REMAINING CS0246 errors" → Agent: "I'll just fix the caching-related ones" (WRONG - fix ALL remaining)
   - ❌ User story: "Complete the feature" → Agent: "The code doesn't exist, marking as blocked" (WRONG - implement it)
   - ❌ User story: "Fix 60 errors in 25 files" → Agent: "I fixed 20 errors in 10 files" (WRONG - must fix all 60)
   - ✅ User story: "Fix REMAINING CS0246 errors" → Agent: "I fixed all remaining CS0246 errors across all files" (CORRECT)
   - ✅ User story: "Implement feature X" → Agent: "I implemented feature X with all acceptance criteria met" (CORRECT)

3. **NO SCRIPTS ALLOWED**
   - ❌ DO NOT create Python scripts
   - ❌ DO NOT create bash scripts
   - ❌ DO NOT use automation
   - ✅ Use Edit tool manually for each file
   - ✅ Make one change at a time
   - ✅ Verify each change

3a. **File Filtering and Formatting Rules (NEW FIX #7 - v4.6.4)**

   **CRITICAL**: If user story involves code formatting (Prettier, ESLint, etc.):

   **BEFORE running any formatters**:
   1. Check if `.prettierignore` exists
   2. If NOT, create it with these exclusions:
      ```
      node_modules/
      dist/
      build/
      coverage/
      *.min.js
      *.min.css
      package-lock.json
      yarn.lock
      .git/
      .next/
      .nuxt/
      ```

   **When running formatters**:
   - ✅ Use specific file patterns: `prettier --write 'src/**/*.{ts,js,json}'`
   - ❌ NEVER use: `prettier --write '**/*'` (too broad)
   - ❌ NEVER format: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `package-lock.json`
   - ✅ Respect `.prettierignore` file

   **Validation**:
   - After formatting, check `git status`
   - If `package-lock.json` or `node_modules` appear, revert them
   - Only stage source code files that should be formatted

4. **Manual Implementation Process**
   For each file in "Files Affected":
   - Use Read tool to read the file
   - Identify the exact lines to change
   - Use Edit tool to make the change
   - Verify the change looks correct
   - Move to next file

5. **Verify Your Worktree**
   ```bash
   # You're already on the correct branch in your worktree
   pwd  # Should show: .../worktrees/[us-xxx]
   git branch --show-current  # Should show: fix/us-xxx-[description]

   # You do NOT need to create a branch - it was created when the worktree was made
   ```

6. **Validate Changes Before Commit (NEW FIX #2 - v4.6.4)**

   **CRITICAL**: Before creating a commit, you MUST verify you actually made changes:

   ```bash
   echo "=========================================="
   echo "DIFF VALIDATION (MANDATORY)"
   echo "=========================================="

   # Check if branch differs from main/master
   MAIN_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | cut -d' ' -f5)
   DIFF_STAT=$(git diff --stat $MAIN_BRANCH...HEAD 2>/dev/null)

   if [ -z "$DIFF_STAT" ]; then
     echo "❌ ERROR: No changes detected between branch and $MAIN_BRANCH"
     echo "This user story was likely already implemented."
     echo "DO NOT create a PR."
     echo ""
     echo "SOLUTION: Report ALREADY_IMPLEMENTED status to orchestrator"
     exit 0
   fi

   # Check file count
   FILE_COUNT=$(git diff --name-only $MAIN_BRANCH...HEAD | wc -l)
   if [ "$FILE_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
     echo "❌ ERROR: No files changed"
     echo "DO NOT create a PR."
     exit 1
   fi

   echo "✓ Verified: $FILE_COUNT file(s) changed"
   echo "$DIFF_STAT"
   echo ""
   ```

   **If diff validation fails**:
   - DO NOT proceed to commit or PR creation
   - Report back that work was already complete
   - This prevents empty PRs from being created

7. **Build Verification**
   After making changes:
   ```bash
   npm run build 2>&1 | grep -E "(error|Error)" | grep -v "node_modules"

   # Count errors in files you modified ONLY
   # Other files can have errors - ignore them
   # Your modified files must have ZERO errors
   ```

8. **Quality Gate Validation (NEW FIX #3 - v4.6.4 - MANDATORY)**

   **ALL quality gates must pass before proceeding**:

   ```bash
   echo "=========================================="
   echo "QUALITY GATE CHECKS (MANDATORY)"
   echo "=========================================="

   # Gate 1: Files were actually modified
   MODIFIED_FILES=$(git status --porcelain | grep -c "^ M" || echo "0")
   if [ "$MODIFIED_FILES" -eq 0 ]; then
     echo "❌ GATE 1 FAILED: No files modified"
     exit 1
   fi
   echo "✓ Gate 1: $MODIFIED_FILES file(s) modified"

   # Gate 2: No unintended files included
   UNINTENDED=$(git status --porcelain | grep -E "(node_modules|dist|build|\.log|package-lock\.json)" || echo "")
   if [ -n "$UNINTENDED" ]; then
     echo "❌ GATE 2 FAILED: Unintended files detected:"
     echo "$UNINTENDED"
     echo "Remove these files from staging area"
     exit 1
   fi
   echo "✓ Gate 2: No unintended files"

   # Gate 3: Acceptance criteria met (manual check)
   echo ""
   echo "Gate 3: Review acceptance criteria from user story"
   echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED:"
   echo "  - Read acceptance criteria from user story file"
   echo "  - Verify each criterion is met"
   echo "  - If ANY criterion is not met, stop and fix"
   echo ""
   read -p "Have ALL acceptance criteria been met? (yes/no): " CRITERIA_MET
   if [ "$CRITERIA_MET" != "yes" ]; then
     echo "❌ GATE 3 FAILED: Acceptance criteria not met"
     exit 1
   fi
   echo "✓ Gate 3: All acceptance criteria met"

   # Gate 4: Commit message follows convention
   echo "✓ Gate 4: Commit message will follow convention (verified at commit time)"

   echo ""
   echo "✓ ALL QUALITY GATES PASSED"
   echo ""
   ```

   **If any gate fails**:
   - DO NOT proceed
   - Fix the issue
   - Re-run quality gates

9. **Code Coverage Verification (NEW v4.4.0 - MANDATORY)**
   Test your implementation and verify code coverage:
   ```bash
   # For JavaScript/TypeScript projects
   if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
     npm run test:coverage
   fi

   # For .NET projects
   if compgen -G "*.csproj" > /dev/null; then
     dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
   fi

   # YOUR CODE MUST MEET ${REQUIRE_COVERAGE}% MINIMUM COVERAGE
   # If coverage is below minimum, add more tests before proceeding
   ```

10. **Git Commit (ENHANCED - Prevents Contamination)**
   ```bash
   # Step 10a: Check what will be committed
   echo "Checking git status before commit..."
   git status

   # Step 10b: List all untracked and modified files
   echo ""
   echo "Files that would be committed:"
   git status --porcelain

   # Step 10c: Remove any contamination BEFORE staging
   # Remove worktree artifacts
   git clean -fd worktrees/ 2>/dev/null || true
   git clean -fd .worktrees/ 2>/dev/null || true

   # Remove PowerShell scripts
   git clean -f fix-*.ps1 2>/dev/null || true

   # Remove investigation files
   git clean -f *-FINDINGS.md *-INVESTIGATION.md *-update-plan.md 2>/dev/null || true

   # Step 10d: Stage ONLY files relevant to this user story
   # DO NOT use "git add ." or "git add -A"
   # Instead, explicitly add only the files you modified for this user story:
   git add <path/to/file1>
   git add <path/to/file2>
   # ... (add each file individually)

   # Step 10e: Verify staged files are correct
   echo ""
   echo "Files staged for commit:"
   git diff --cached --name-only

   # Step 10f: Verify no unexpected files are staged
   if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "(worktree|\.ps1|FINDINGS|INVESTIGATION)"; then
     echo "ERROR: Contaminated files detected in staging area!"
     echo "Unstaging contaminated files..."
     git reset HEAD worktrees/
     git reset HEAD .worktrees/
     git reset HEAD fix-*.ps1
     git reset HEAD *-FINDINGS.md
     git reset HEAD *-INVESTIGATION.md
     git reset HEAD -- "-"  # Template file
   fi

   # Step 10g: Commit with descriptive message
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(user-story-id): brief description in lowercase

Detailed explanation of changes.

11. **Push to Remote**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin [branch-name]
   ```

12. **Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   PR_URL=$(gh pr create \

   fi
   ```

   **Note on GitHub Copilot Reviews:**
   - GitHub Copilot will automatically review PRs if enabled in repository settings
   - Do NOT attempt to add reviewers via `--reviewer` flag (it will fail with HTTP 422 error)
   - The correct reviewer name is `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`, but it cannot be added via CLI/API
   - Copilot reviews appear automatically after PR creation if the feature is enabled

13. **PR Review Feedback Loop (NEW FIX #5 - v4.6.4 - MANDATORY)**

   **CRITICAL**: After creating the PR, you MUST wait for and address review feedback:

   ```bash
   echo "=========================================="
   echo "PR REVIEW FEEDBACK LOOP"
   echo "=========================================="

   # Get PR number from previous gh pr create output
   PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current) --json number --jq '.[0].number')

   if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
     echo "❌ ERROR: Could not find PR number"
     exit 1
   fi

   echo "PR #$PR_NUMBER created. Monitoring for review comments..."

   # Wait for Copilot auto-review (typically takes 30-90 seconds)
   echo "Waiting 90 seconds for GitHub Copilot review..."
   sleep 90

   # Check for review comments using GraphQL
   UNRESOLVED_COUNT=$(gh api graphql -f query='
     query {
       repository(owner: "'"$(gh repo view --json owner --jq '.owner.login')"'", name: "'"$(gh repo view --json name --jq '.name')"'") {
         pullRequest(number: '"$PR_NUMBER"') {
           reviewThreads(first: 100) {
             nodes {
               isResolved
               isOutdated
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes | map(select(.isResolved == false and .isOutdated == false)) | length')

   echo "Found $UNRESOLVED_COUNT unresolved review comment(s)"

   # If there are unresolved comments, address them
   if [ "$UNRESOLVED_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
     echo ""
     echo "⚠️  UNRESOLVED REVIEW COMMENTS DETECTED"
     echo "You MUST address all review comments before reporting success."
     echo ""
     echo "Steps to address comments:"
     echo "1. View comments: gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --web"
     echo "2. Read each comment carefully"
     echo "3. Make required code changes using Edit tool"
     echo "4. Commit changes: git commit -am 'fix: address review comments'"
     echo "5. Push changes: git push"
     echo "6. Wait 60 seconds and re-check for new comments"
     echo "7. Repeat until all comments are resolved"
     echo ""
     echo "DO NOT report success until reviewDecision is APPROVED or no unresolved comments remain."
     exit 1
   else
     echo "✓ No unresolved review comments found"
   fi
   ```

   **Review Iteration Loop**:
   - After addressing comments, wait 60 seconds for re-review
   - Check again for unresolved comments
   - Repeat until all comments are resolved
   - Only then proceed to verification step

   **IMPORTANT**: Never report success until PR is in good standing (no unresolved comments, no requested changes)

14. **MANDATORY: Verify Success BEFORE Reporting Complete**

   **CRITICAL**: You MUST run these verification checks BEFORE claiming success:

   ```bash
   echo "=========================================="
   echo "AGENT SELF-VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)"
   echo "=========================================="

   echo "2. Verifying PR created..."
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --json number --jq '.[0].number')
   if [ -n "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
     PR_URL="https://github.com/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')/pull/$PR_NUMBER"
     echo "✓ PR created: $PR_URL"
   else
     echo "❌ FAILURE: No PR found for branch $CURRENT_BRANCH"
     exit 1

   **IMPORTANT**:
   - Run this verification script BEFORE reporting success to the orchestrator
   - If ANY verification fails, DO NOT claim success
   - Fix the issues and re-run verification
   - Only report success after ALL checks pass

### Success Criteria
Your implementation is complete when:
- All files listed in user story are modified
- All acceptance criteria from user story are met
- Modified files build with ZERO errors
- Git commit created
- Pull request created
- NO other files were modified

### Report Back
When complete, provide:
1. Number of files modified
2. Build status (pass/fail for YOUR files only)
3. Acceptance criteria status (met/not met)
4. Commit SHA
5. PR URL

**IMPORTANT**:
- Work slowly and carefully
- Make one change at a time
- Verify each step
- Do NOT use scripts
- Stay within user story scope
```

**Launch ALL agents in PARALLEL** - each in its own git worktree.

### Step 5: Monitor Agents and Handle Incomplete Work (Updated for v4.2)

**v4.2 NOTE**: For batched user stories, this step happens AFTER EACH BATCH automatically. For non-batched stories, use this workflow:

**Agent Context Limitation**: Agents have context windows and may not complete large tasks in one session.

**After each agent (or batch) completes, check if work is incomplete:**

```bash
# For each user story, check if work is complete
cd worktrees/[us-xxx]/
git status  # Check for uncommitted changes

# If changes exist, verify completion against user story
# Example: Check remaining TS6133 errors
npm run build 2>&1 | grep "TS6133" | wc -l
```

**If agent stopped before completing 100% of user story:**

1. **Create Progress Checkpoint**
   ```bash
   # Commit partial work as checkpoint (do NOT push or create PR yet)
   cd worktrees/[us-xxx]/
   git add .
   git commit -m "WIP: [US-XXX] Partial implementation - checkpoint

   Progress: X/Y files completed
   Remaining: [list remaining work]

   This is a work-in-progress checkpoint for agent continuation."

   # DO NOT push yet - this is just a local checkpoint
   ```

2. **Launch Continuation Agent**
   Launch a new agent with modified instructions:

   ```markdown
   ## Agent Task: CONTINUE Implementation of [US-XXX]

   ### 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY RULES - READ FIRST 🚨

   **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NEVER CLOSE PULL REQUESTS:**
   ```
   YOU ARE FORBIDDEN FROM CLOSING, MERGING, OR APPROVING PULL REQUESTS.

   NEVER use these commands:
   ❌ gh pr close
   ❌ gh pr merge
   ❌ gh api ... -f state=closed
   ❌ gh pr review --approve

   YOU MAY ONLY:
   ✅ gh pr create (create new PRs)
   ✅ gh pr comment (add comments)
   ✅ gh pr view (view PR details)
   ✅ git push (update PR with new commits)

   ONLY THE USER CAN CLOSE, MERGE, OR APPROVE PULL REQUESTS.
   ```

   **IMPORTANT**: A previous agent started this work but hit context limits.
   You are continuing where they left off.

   ### Working Directory
   {WORKING_DIRECTORY}/worktrees/[us-xxx]/

   ### User Story
   Read: ~/.claude/user-stories/{PROJECT_NAME}/bug_fixes/[US-XXX].md

   ### Previous Progress
   Check what was already done:
   ```bash
   # See what files were already modified
   git log -1 --stat

   # Check current git status
   git status

   # Verify what's still needed
   npm run build 2>&1 | grep "TS6133"  # or relevant error pattern
   ```

   ### Your Task
   1. **Assess Previous Work**: Review git log and modified files
   2. **Identify Remaining Work**: Check user story vs what's already done
   3. **Complete Remaining Items**: Finish the files that weren't touched yet
   4. **Follow Same Rules**:
      - Use Edit tool manually (NO scripts)
      - Only touch files in user story
      - Verify each change
      - NEVER close, merge, or approve PRs

   ### When You're Done
   1. **Amend the WIP Checkpoint Commit** (not create new commit):
      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit --amend -m "[proper final commit message]"
      ```
   2. **Verify 100% complete** against user story acceptance criteria
   3. **Push and create PR** (only if 100% complete, but NEVER close/merge it)

   ### Success Criteria
   - ALL files from user story are modified
   - ALL acceptance criteria met
   - Build verification passes
   - Commit created (or amended)
   - PR created (but NOT closed or merged)
   ```

3. **Repeat Until Complete**
   - If continuation agent also hits limits, repeat process
   - Create new checkpoint, launch another continuation agent
   - Continue until user story is 100% complete

4. **Final Verification**
   - Only proceed to Step 5.5 verification when work is 100% complete
   - Verify all acceptance criteria met
   - Verify build passes for all modified files

### Step 5.5: Mandatory Agent Verification (NEW in v4.3.4 - CRITICAL)

**THIS STEP IS ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**

After EACH agent reports completion, you MUST verify their work meets success criteria BEFORE accepting it. Agents may claim success when they actually failed - you must verify independently.

**For each agent that reports completion:**

```bash

**CRITICAL RULES FOR STEP 5.5**:

1. **NEVER SKIP THIS VERIFICATION** - Even if agent claims success
2. **REJECT if build fails** - ANY compilation errors = REJECTED
3. **MARK AS BLOCKED if prerequisites missing** - Agent found files don't exist = BLOCKED
4. **MARK AS INCOMPLETE if no PR** - Agent didn't finish the workflow = INCOMPLETE
5. **ONLY ACCEPT if all checks pass** - Build succeeds, PR created, acceptance criteria met

**REJECTION DECISION TREE**:

```
Agent reports "complete" → Run verification
                            ↓
                   Check build status
                            ↓

              │                           │
              ↓                           ↓
         REJECTED                    Check PR status
   Launch fix agent                       ↓
                              ┌───────────┴───────────┐
                              │                       │
                         PR exists?              No PR found?
                              │                       │
                              ↓                       ↓
                         ACCEPTED               INCOMPLETE
                    Proceed to Step 6     Launch continuation agent
```

**DO NOT PROCEED TO STEP 5.6 (Production Readiness Check)** until:
- All agents are either ACCEPTED_PENDING_READINESS, BLOCKED, or fixed by continuation agents
- No agents have PENDING_FIX or PENDING_COMPLETION status
- Build verification confirms 0 errors for all accepted agents

### Step 5.6: Production Readiness Check (NEW in v4.3.6 - CRITICAL)

**THIS STEP IS ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**

After agents pass build verification in Step 5.5, verify that implementations are production-ready (not placeholder/stub code). Step 5.5 ensures code compiles; Step 5.6 ensures code actually works.

**Why This Matters**: Step 5.5 only checks if code compiles. Code can compile but still be non-functional:
- Placeholder implementations that always return false
- Functions that are called but never defined
- Stub code with TODO comments
- Missing MCP tool integrations
- XSS vulnerabilities and security issues

**For each agent that has status ACCEPTED_PENDING_READINESS:**

**CRITICAL RULES FOR STEP 5.6**:

1. **NEVER SKIP THIS CHECK** - Even if build passes in Step 5.5
2. **REJECT if placeholder code found** - TODO, FIXME, stub, not implemented = REJECTED
3. **REJECT if functions undefined** - Called but not defined = REJECTED
4. **REJECT if security issues found** - XSS, SQL injection patterns = REJECTED
5. **REJECT if performance issues found** - Sync fs ops, redundant parsing = REJECTED
6. **REJECT if linter fails** - Any linter errors = REJECTED
7. **ONLY ACCEPT if all checks pass** - Production-ready code only

**DO NOT PROCEED TO STEP 6 (Copilot Review)** until:
- All agents have status ACCEPTED (not ACCEPTED_PENDING_READINESS)
- No agents have PENDING_PRODUCTION_FIX status
- Production readiness verification confirms all implementations are real, not placeholders

### Step 6: GitHub Copilot Review Integration (NEW in v4.3)

After pull requests are created, check for and address Copilot review comments:

```bash
# For each PR created
for pr_number in ${PR_NUMBERS[@]}; do
  echo "Checking PR #$pr_number for Copilot review comments..."

  # Request Copilot review if not already done
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$pr_number/reviews \
    | jq -r '.[].user.login' \
    | grep -q "github-advanced-security" || {
    echo "Requesting Copilot review..."
    # Copilot reviews happen automatically, just wait a moment
    sleep 10
  }

  # Check for UNRESOLVED Copilot comments (comments on the current HEAD commit)
  # Get the HEAD commit SHA for this PR
  HEAD_COMMIT=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$pr_number | jq -r '.head.sha')

  # Count comments that match the HEAD commit (these are unresolved)
  COPILOT_COMMENTS_COUNT=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$pr_number/comments \
    | jq --arg head "$HEAD_COMMIT" '[.[] | select(.user.login == "Copilot" and .commit_id == $head)] | length')

  if [ "$COPILOT_COMMENTS_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠ Copilot has $COPILOT_COMMENTS_COUNT comments on PR #$pr_number"
    echo "Launching agent to address Copilot feedback..."

    # Launch agent to fix Copilot comments
    # Agent task: Address Copilot review comments
    cat > /tmp/copilot-fix-task.md <<EOF
## Agent Task: Address GitHub Copilot Review Comments for PR #$pr_number

### 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY RULES - READ FIRST 🚨

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NEVER CLOSE PULL REQUESTS:**
\`\`\`
YOU ARE FORBIDDEN FROM CLOSING, MERGING, OR APPROVING PULL REQUESTS.

NEVER use these commands:
❌ gh pr close
❌ gh pr merge
❌ gh api ... -f state=closed
❌ gh pr review --approve

YOU MAY ONLY:
✅ gh pr comment (add comments)
✅ gh pr view (view PR details)
✅ git push (update PR with new commits)
✅ mcp__github__pull_request_read --method get_review_comments

Your job is to FIX issues, not to close/merge/approve the PR.
ONLY THE USER CAN CLOSE, MERGE, OR APPROVE PULL REQUESTS.
\`\`\`

### Your Role
Fix ALL issues raised by GitHub Copilot in the pull request review.
DO NOT close, merge, or approve the PR - only fix the issues.

### Working Directory
Continue working in: worktrees/[us-xxx]/

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Retrieve UNRESOLVED Comments Only

**DO NOT rely on pre-provided comment lists - they may be stale!**

YOU MUST retrieve the CURRENT list of **UNRESOLVED** Copilot review comments at the START of your work:

\`\`\`bash
# Step 1: Get the HEAD commit SHA for this PR
HEAD_COMMIT=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$pr_number | jq -r '.head.sha')

# Step 2: Filter comments that match the HEAD commit (these are UNRESOLVED)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$pr_number/comments | jq --arg head "$HEAD_COMMIT" '.[] | select(.user.login == "Copilot" and .commit_id == $head)'

# Or use the MCP GitHub tool:
# 1. Get PR details: mcp__github__pull_request_read --method get --owner {owner} --repo {repo} --pullNumber $pr_number
# 2. Extract head.sha from the response
# 3. Get comments: mcp__github__pull_request_read --method get_review_comments --owner {owner} --repo {repo} --pullNumber $pr_number
# 4. Filter to only include comments where commit_id == head.sha
\`\`\`

**Why filtering by HEAD commit is CRITICAL:**
- GitHub API returns ALL comments from all commits, including old/resolved ones
- Comments on older commits are already resolved (code has changed since then)
- Only comments on the HEAD commit (current state) are UNRESOLVED
- The \`position\` field is UNRELIABLE - GitHub resets it to 1 when it can't map comments
- The \`commit_id\` field tells you which version of code the comment is about
- After you push fixes, Copilot may add NEW comments on your new HEAD commit
- You must re-check for NEW comments on the NEW HEAD commit after your push

### Instructions
1. **FIRST**: Retrieve the COMPLETE, CURRENT list of **UNRESOLVED** Copilot review comments from GitHub (filter by HEAD commit only)
2. **READ EACH COMMENT CAREFULLY**:
   - Note the file path and line number
   - **CRITICAL**: Many Copilot comments include ```suggestion blocks with EXACT code to implement
   - If a suggestion block exists, you MUST use it EXACTLY as shown
   - Read the comment body to understand what Copilot wants changed
3. **OUTCOME-BASED APPROACH** (v4.6.3):

   **THE ONLY SUCCESS METRIC: Comments must disappear from HEAD after your change.**

   For EACH comment:

   **Step 1: Understand Copilot's Concern**
   - Read the comment body carefully
   - Identify what Copilot is worried about
   - Assume Copilot is right (it almost always is)

   **Step 2: Choose Your Solution**
   - Option A: Use Copilot's exact suggestion (if provided and good)
   - Option B: Implement your own solution that addresses the same concern
   - Either is fine - what matters is the comment disappears

   **Step 3: Make Code Change**
   - Actually modify the code (not just add comments/docs)
   - The change must address Copilot's concern
   - Push the change

   **Step 4: Verify Result**
   - Wait 60 seconds for Copilot to review (comprehensive changes need time)
   - Check if comment still exists on new HEAD
   - If comment gone → Success ✅
   - If comment remains → Try different approach

   **CRITICAL RULES**:
   - ❌ NEVER say "already implemented" - if comment exists, it's not fixed adequately
   - ❌ NEVER just add docs/design notes - must change actual code
   - ❌ NEVER assume comment will magically disappear - verify it
   - ✅ ALWAYS make code changes that Copilot will recognize
   - ✅ ALWAYS verify comment disappeared after push
   - ✅ If comment persists, iterate with different approach

4. **ITERATIVE REFINEMENT**:

   After each push:
   - Get NEW HEAD SHA
   - Count comments on NEW HEAD
   - If count decreased → good progress
   - If count same/increased → try different fixes
   - Continue until count = 0 or max iterations reached
5. Verify changes build successfully (continue even if build has pre-existing errors unrelated to your changes)
6. **CRITICAL**: Commit with REGULAR PUSH (not force push) - force push does NOT trigger Copilot review
7. Wait 30 seconds for Copilot to automatically review the push
8. **ITERATIVE LOOP**: Re-check NEW HEAD for comments. If ANY exist, repeat steps 2-7 up to 3 times maximum
9. **MANDATORY VERIFICATION**: Run the verification command (see below) and include actual output in your report
10. After 3 iterations OR when verification shows ZERO comments, report final status using required format
11. NEVER close, merge, or approve the PR

### CRITICAL: Outcome-Based Success Criteria (v4.6.3)

**THE ONLY METRIC THAT MATTERS**:
```
Comments on HEAD BEFORE push: N
Comments on HEAD AFTER push + 60s: M

Success = M < N (progress made)
Ultimate Goal = M = 0 (all resolved)
```

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS**:
- ✅ Every comment MUST result in a code change (not just docs)
- ✅ After each push, verify if comments disappeared
- ✅ If comment persists after push, try different approach
- ✅ Continue iterating until comment count = 0

**DO**:
- Make code changes that address Copilot's concern
- Push after each batch of changes
- Wait 60 seconds for Copilot to re-review (comprehensive changes need time)
- Check if comments still exist on new HEAD
- If comments remain, analyze why and try different approach
- Document which approach you tried and result

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Say "already implemented" - comment existence proves it's not adequate
- ❌ Add only docs/design notes without code changes
- ❌ Assume comment will disappear without verifying
- ❌ Give up if first approach doesn't work - iterate!
- ❌ Report success without verifying comment count on HEAD

**VERIFICATION PROCESS**:

After EVERY push:
```bash
# Get new HEAD
NEW_HEAD=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$pr_number | jq -r '.head.sha')

# Count comments on new HEAD
NEW_COUNT=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$pr_number/comments --paginate | jq --arg head "$NEW_HEAD" '[.[] | select(.user.login == "Copilot" and .commit_id == $head)] | length')

echo "Comments on new HEAD: $NEW_COUNT"

if [ "$NEW_COUNT" -lt "$OLD_COUNT" ]; then
  echo "✅ Progress: $OLD_COUNT → $NEW_COUNT"
else
  echo "⚠️  No progress: $OLD_COUNT → $NEW_COUNT (try different approach)"
fi
```

**APPROACH SELECTION** (both valid):
- **Use Copilot's suggestion**: If provided and looks good
- **Use your own solution**: If you have better idea that addresses same concern

What matters is **RESULT** (comment disappears), not **METHOD** (how you fixed it)

### MANDATORY: Final Report Format

You MUST report your results using this EXACT format:

\`\`\`
## Final Report: PR #{pr_number} Copilot Comment Resolution

**Iterations Completed**: [number between 1-3]

**Final HEAD Commit SHA**: [paste from verification command output]

**Remaining Comments on HEAD**: [paste count from verification command output]

**Status**: [Choose ONE: SUCCESS (if 0 comments) | PARTIAL (if comments remain) | FAILED (if errors)]

**Verification Command Output**:
\`\`\`
[Paste the COMPLETE output from the "MANDATORY FINAL VERIFICATION" section above]
\`\`\`

**Comments Addressed**: [initial count] → [final count]

**Implementation Details** (Outcome-Based Format):

For EACH iteration, report:

---
**Iteration [N]**

**Comments BEFORE**: [count on HEAD before changes]
**HEAD SHA BEFORE**: [sha]

**Changes Made**:
1. Comment about [issue]: [What you changed]
   - Copilot concern: [summary]
   - My solution: [what I did - code change, not docs]
   - File: [path:lines changed]

2. Comment about [issue]: [What you changed]
   - Copilot concern: [summary]
   - My solution: [what I did]
   - File: [path:lines changed]

[... for all comments addressed in this iteration]

**Push**: Committed and pushed changes
**Wait**: 30 seconds for Copilot re-review

**Comments AFTER**: [count on NEW HEAD]
**HEAD SHA AFTER**: [new sha]

**Outcome**:
- ✅ Progress: [before] → [after] ([N] comments resolved)
  OR
- ⚠️  No progress: [before] → [after] (comments persisted, trying different approach)
  OR
- ❌ Regression: [before] → [after] (new comments appeared)

---

[Repeat for each iteration]

**Final Summary**:
- Total iterations: [N]
- Starting comments: [count]
- Final comments: [count]
- Comments resolved: [starting - final]
- Status: [SUCCESS if 0, PARTIAL if >0, FAILED if error]
\`\`\`

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT report SUCCESS unless final verification shows 0 comments on HEAD.
**CRITICAL**: MUST show comment count BEFORE and AFTER each push to prove progress.
**CRITICAL**: If comments persist after iteration, you MUST try different approach in next iteration.

### Success Criteria
- ALL current Copilot comments addressed (verified by retrieving fresh comment list)
- NO new comments appeared after final push (checked with timestamp comparison)
- Changes build successfully
- PR updated with fixes
- Comment added to PR confirming fixes
- PR remains OPEN (NOT closed, merged, or approved)

**Why This Matters**:
- Copilot reviews catch issues that automated tools and agents might miss
- Addressing comments immediately keeps PRs clean
- Automated integration = no manual followup needed

### Step 6b: Orchestrator Validation (NEW FIX #6 - v4.6.4 - MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: After ALL agents report completion, the orchestrator MUST validate their outputs before declaring success.

```bash
echo "=========================================="
echo "ORCHESTRATOR VALIDATION"
echo "=========================================="

# Track validation status

          reviewThreads(first: 100) {
            nodes {
              isResolved
              isOutdated
            }
          }

  # Validation 4: Check PR title follows convention
  PR_TITLE=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json title --jq '.title' 2>/dev/null)
  if ! echo "$PR_TITLE" | grep -qE '^\[US-[A-Z]+-[0-9]+\]|^(feat|fix|refactor|chore)\(US-[A-Z]+-[0-9]+\)'; then

  echo ""
  echo "❌ CRITICAL: Success rate below 50% - workflow needs review"
  exit 1
fi

echo ""
echo "✓ ORCHESTRATOR VALIDATION COMPLETE"

```

**Key Improvements from Fix #6**:
- Validates ALL PRs before declaring success
- Auto-closes empty PRs with explanation
- Detects merge conflicts and unresolved comments
- Calculates success rate to catch systematic failures
- Prevents "disaster scenarios" like the 4 empty PRs incident

### Step 6c: PR Contamination Detection (NEW - Prevents Merging Bad PRs)

**Purpose**: Detect and warn about contaminated PRs before they get merged

```bash
echo ""
echo "Step 6c: Verifying PR cleanliness..."

for pr_number in "${CREATED_PRS[@]}"; do
  echo "  Checking PR #$pr_number..."

  # Get PR files
  PR_FILES=$(gh pr view $pr_number --json files | jq -r '.files[].path')
  FILE_COUNT=$(echo "$PR_FILES" | wc -l)

  # Check for contamination indicators
  HAS_WORKTREES=$(echo "$PR_FILES" | grep -i "worktree" || true)
  HAS_SCRIPTS=$(echo "$PR_FILES" | grep "\.ps1$" || true)
  HAS_TEMPLATE=$(echo "$PR_FILES" | grep "^-$" || true)
  HAS_FINDINGS=$(echo "$PR_FILES" | grep -E "(FINDINGS|INVESTIGATION|update-plan)" || true)

  CONTAMINATED=false

  if [ -n "$HAS_WORKTREES" ]; then
    echo "    ⚠️  WARNING: PR contains worktree artifacts:"
    echo "$HAS_WORKTREES" | sed 's/^/      /'
    CONTAMINATED=true
  fi

  if [ -n "$HAS_SCRIPTS" ]; then
    echo "    ⚠️  WARNING: PR contains PowerShell scripts:"
    echo "$HAS_SCRIPTS" | sed 's/^/      /'
    CONTAMINATED=true
  fi

  if [ -n "$HAS_TEMPLATE" ]; then
    echo "    ⚠️  WARNING: PR contains template file '-'"
    CONTAMINATED=true
  fi

  if [ -n "$HAS_FINDINGS" ]; then
    echo "    ⚠️  WARNING: PR contains investigation files:"
    echo "$HAS_FINDINGS" | sed 's/^/      /'
    CONTAMINATED=true
  fi

  # Check for excessive line changes (possible file rewrite/encoding issue)
  TOTAL_CHANGES=$(gh pr view $pr_number --json files | jq '[.files[] | .additions + .deletions] | add')

  if [ $TOTAL_CHANGES -gt 1000 ] && [ $FILE_COUNT -lt 3 ]; then
    echo "    ⚠️  WARNING: PR has $TOTAL_CHANGES line changes across only $FILE_COUNT files"
    echo "       This might indicate line ending changes or file encoding issues"
    echo "       Expected changes for this user story should be much smaller"
    CONTAMINATED=true
  fi

  if [ "$CONTAMINATED" = true ]; then
    echo "    ❌ PR #$pr_number is CONTAMINATED and should be closed/recreated"
    echo ""
    echo "    Recommended action:"
    echo "    1. Close PR #$pr_number with comment explaining contamination"
    echo "    2. Create clean branch from base"
    echo "    3. Cherry-pick only the relevant commit(s)"
    echo "    4. Create new PR with clean history"
    echo ""

    # Add to contaminated PRs array
    CONTAMINATED_PRS+=($pr_number)
  else
    echo "    ✅ PR #$pr_number is clean"
  fi
done

if [ ${#CONTAMINATED_PRS[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "⚠️  CONTAMINATED PRS DETECTED: ${#CONTAMINATED_PRS[@]}"
  echo "   PRs: ${CONTAMINATED_PRS[@]}"
  echo ""
  echo "   These PRs should be closed and recreated with clean commits."
  echo "   DO NOT MERGE CONTAMINATED PRS - they will pollute the repository!"
fi
```

### Step 7: Verification

After ALL agents complete AND orchestrator validation passes:

1. **Verify Scope Adherence**
   ```bash
   # List files changed
   git diff --name-only master...[branch-name]

   # Compare against user story "Files Affected" list
   # Should match exactly
   ```

2. **Verify Build (Scoped to User Story Files)**
   ```bash
   npm run build 2>&1 > build_output.txt

   # Check only user story files for errors
   for file in [user-story-files]; do
     grep "$file" build_output.txt | grep "error"
   done

   # Should be ZERO errors in user story files
   # Other files can have errors - ignore
   ```

3. **Verify Acceptance Criteria**
   - Read user story acceptance criteria
   - Check each criterion manually
   - Mark each as met/not met

4. **Update Review Log**
   ```bash
   Append to review-log.md:
   - User Story ID
   - Branch name
   - Commit SHA
   - PR URL
   - Files modified
   - Acceptance criteria status
   - Build status (scoped)
   - Timestamp
   ```

### Step 8: Cleanup Worktrees

After all verification complete:

```bash
# Remove all worktrees (branches remain on remote for PRs)
git worktree list | grep "worktrees/" | awk '{print $1}' | while read wt; do
  git worktree remove "$wt" 2>/dev/null || true
done

# Remove worktrees directory
rm -rf worktrees/

# Return to main branch
git checkout "$MAIN_BRANCH"
```

**Note**: Worktrees are temporary - branches stay on remote for PRs

### Step 8.5: Move Completed User Stories to Archive

After worktree cleanup, move successfully merged user stories to the completed folder:

```bash
echo ""
echo "=========================================="
echo "ARCHIVING COMPLETED USER STORIES"
echo "=========================================="
echo ""

# Directory paths
USER_STORIES_DIR="$HOME/.claude/user-stories/$PROJECT_NAME"
COMPLETED_DIR="$USER_STORIES_DIR/completed"

# Ensure completed directory exists
mkdir -p "$COMPLETED_DIR"

# Move completed user stories from COMPLETED_STORIES array (populated in Step 1)
if [ ${#COMPLETED_STORIES[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "Moving ${#COMPLETED_STORIES[@]} completed user stories to archive..."

  MOVED_COUNT=0
  for story_id in "${COMPLETED_STORIES[@]}"; do
    # Convert to lowercase for filename matching
    story_file=$(echo "$story_id" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

    # Search for the story file in all category directories
    for category in bug_fixes code_improvements new_features; do
      SOURCE_FILE="$USER_STORIES_DIR/$category/${story_file}.md"

      if [ -f "$SOURCE_FILE" ]; then
        # Move to completed folder
        mv "$SOURCE_FILE" "$COMPLETED_DIR/"
        echo "  ✓ Moved: $story_id (from $category/)"
        ((MOVED_COUNT++))
        break  # Found and moved, stop searching other categories
      fi
    done
  done

  echo ""
  echo "✓ Archived $MOVED_COUNT completed user stories"
  echo "Location: $COMPLETED_DIR"
else
  echo "No completed user stories to archive (all stories are new or in progress)"
fi

echo ""
echo "=========================================="
echo "✓ ARCHIVE COMPLETE"
echo "=========================================="
echo ""
```

**What This Does**:
1. Uses the `COMPLETED_STORIES` array populated in Step 1 (from merged PRs)
2. Searches each category folder (bug_fixes, code_improvements, new_features) for matching user story files
3. Moves matched files to `~/.claude/user-stories/{PROJECT_NAME}/completed/`
4. Provides clear feedback on what was moved
5. Prevents re-processing of already-completed work

**Benefits**:
- Keeps active user story folders clean
- Prevents duplicate work on already-merged stories
- Provides clear archive of completed work
- Maintains audit trail of what's been done

### Step 9: Rejection Protocol

If verification fails:
- Update review-log.md with status: FAIL
- List specific failure reason
- Do NOT merge PR
- Options:
  - **Option A**: Fix issues manually
  - **Option B**: Launch new agent with clearer instructions
  - **Option C**: Defer to later

### Step 10: Phase Completion

- Only proceed to next phase when ALL user stories have status: PASS or DEFERRED
- Generate phase summary report:
  - Total stories: X
  - Completed successfully: X
  - Failed (need rework): X
  - Deferred: X
  - Total commits: X
  - Total PRs: X
- Request explicit approval before starting next phase

## Final Cleanup Step (NEW - v4.6.5)

After processing all user stories, run the cleanup script to check for merged PRs and move completed stories:

```bash
echo ""
echo "=========================================="
echo "FINAL CLEANUP - CHECKING FOR MERGED PRS"
echo "=========================================="

# Detect project name from current directory
PROJECT_NAME=$(basename "$(pwd)")

# Run cleanup script
if [ -f "$HOME/.claude/scripts/agent-coordination-cleanup.sh" ]; then
  bash "$HOME/.claude/scripts/agent-coordination-cleanup.sh" "$HOME/.claude/user-stories" "$PROJECT_NAME"
  echo "✓ Cleanup complete"
else
  echo "⚠️  Cleanup script not found at ~/.claude/scripts/agent-coordination-cleanup.sh"
  echo "   Completed stories will need to be moved manually"
fi
```

**What This Does**:
- Checks all stories with "pr-created" status
- Polls GitHub to see if PRs have been merged
- Automatically moves merged stories to `completed/` folder
- Updates metadata to prevent future duplicate work
- Provides summary of current story statuses
